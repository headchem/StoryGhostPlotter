FADE IN:

BEGIN TITLES: the song ARABIAN NIGHTS, sung over scenes of: the desert and the city of AGRABAH, in all its exotic splendor.

NARRATOR
~OH I COME FROM A LAND FROM A FARAWAY PLACE
~WHERE THE CARAVAN CAMELS ROAM
~WHERE THEY'LL CUT OFF YOUR EAR IF THEY DON'T LIKE
~YOUR FACE
~IT'S BARBARIC BUT HEY -- IT'S HOME
~WHEN THE WINDS FROM THE EAST
~AND THE SUN'S FROM THE WEST
~AND THE SAND IN THE GLASS IS RIGHT
~COME ON DOWN STOP ON BY
~HOP A CARPET AND FLY
~IT'S ANOTHER ARABIAN NIGHT
~ARABIAN NIGHTS
~LIKE ARABIAN DAYS
~MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
~ARE HOTTER THAN HOT
~IN A LOTTA GOOD WAYS

EXT. AGRABAH - BAZAAR - EVENING

END TITLES as THE NARRATOR, a street vendor, rides a heavily- laden camel through the bazaar, the CLOMP CLOMP of the camel's hooves falling in beat with the song.

NARRATOR
~... ARABIAN NIGHTS
~'NEATH ARABIAN MOONS
~A FOOL OFF HIS GUARD
~COULD FALL AND FALL HARD
~OUT THERE ON THE DUNES...

The camel kneels and the Narrator slides off with a flourish. He brightens, noticing the audience, speaks into camera:

NARRATOR
Salaam and good evening to you, worthy friend! Please. ..come closer...Welcome to Agraba of mystery...of enchantment... the finest ceramics this side of the River Jordan...

He whips a jug from off the camel's back, displays it. Noticing a crack, quickly rotates it around to hide the flaw.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
No? Then perhaps this elegantly appointed fruit basket would be more to your liking..?

He nods his head hopefully, but the nod turns into a headshake.

NARRATOR
Ah...I can see that you are only interested in the rare...I think, then, you would be most rewarded to Consider... this!

He displays a lamp: old, dented, dust-covered.

NARRATOR
Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance...like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside, that counts. This is no ordinary lamp--

The camera's interest in the lamp wanes, starts to turn away.

NARRATOR
(enticing, teasing)
It once contained a magical Genie of great power...
(camera comes back; the Narrator smiles)
Ah, that interests you. Perhaps you would like to hear the tale. But it doesn't begin with the lamp.

The Narrator pours glitter from the lamp...tosses a fistful up into the sky. The glitter becomes stars.

NARRATOR
(0.S.)
It begins on a dark night--

We slowly PAN DOWN from the star-filled sky to reveal-- EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

A silhouetted figure on horseback. Motionless, it looks as though he has been waiting on those silent dunes for a thousand years.

NARRATOR
(0.S.)
--where a dark man waits..

His name is JAFFAR. His mind works the way he looks: all long lines and deep sharp angles.

NARRATOR
(O.S.)
-with a dark purpose...

A rider nears, reins up: a grimy, shifty THIEF.

JAFAR
You are late.

THIEF
A thousand apologies, O patient one.

JAFAR
You have it then?

With a grin, the Thief produces half of a SCARAB MEDALLION. Jafar reaches for it. The Thief holds it out of reach.

THIEF
I had to slit a few throats...
(smug)
Ah-ah. The treasure.

Suddenly there is a screech--IAGO, Jafar's parrot companion, swoops in...RIPS the scarab from the Thief's fingers.

Iago lands on Jafar's shoulder, drops the scarab into a pleased Jafar's hand.

The Thief sucks his bleeding fingers, no longer smug.

JAFAR

Trust me, my pungent friend. You'll get what's coming to you.

IAGO
What's coming to you--awk!

Jafar reaches into his robe. Produces the other half of the scarab. He's waited for this moment for a long time. He fits the halves together--

Thunder BOOMS--the scarab GLOWS--then LEAPS from Jafar's hands, STREAKS away across the dunes.

JAFAR
Quickly! Follow the trail!

Jafar spurs his steed, races after it. Iago is thrown from his perch. He squawks and flies after him. ' Jafar and the Thief race after the scarab.

JAFAR
Faster!

The scarab streaks up to a small sandstone outcropping. The scarab traces a pattern around the stone--then SPLITS. The halves insert themselves in two notches in the stone. They look like glowing pupils in a huge pair of eyes.

Jafar reins up, dismounts anxiously. Shouts an incantation.

JAFAR
SIM SALAH BIM!

The eyes flash. The earth trembles. A huge TIGER HEAD rises up, formed from the sand itself. A BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHT blasts out of the mouth of the cave.

Jafar is awed.

JAFAR
At last! After all my years of searching--The Cave of Wonders...

IAGO
Cave of Wonders!

Jafar pushes the Thief forward.

JAFAR
Remember--bring me the lamp. The rest of the treasure is yours-- but the _lamp_...is _mine_.

The Thief steps forward warily...onto the Tiger's lip.

IAGO
The lamp! Squawk!

And then a revelation: Alone with Jafar, Iago is smart, articulate-- and short-tempered. He whispers to Jafar:

IAGO
Geez...you just can't find good help nowadays...

Suddenly--

TIGER-GOD
WHO DISTURBS MY SLUMBER?

The Thief jumps back.

THIEF
Er..it is I...Gazeem, a humble thief.

TIGER-GOD
KNOW THIS! ONLY ONE MAY ENTER
WHOM I DEEM WISE ENOUGH.
ONE WHOSE WORTH LIES DEEP WITHIN;
THE DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH.

The Thief looks back at Jafar, who acts like there is no danger.

JAFAR
What are you waiting for? Go on!

In the cave's mouth, stairs lead down. The Thief takes them, descending, out of view. Jafar and Iago wait.

JAFAR
Well?

There is no response...then suddenly, the light from inside the cave becomes brighter.

THIEF
(0.S.)
Oh..!

JAFAR
Yes? Do you see the lamp?

Jafar leans closer, shielding his eyes, trying to see. Iago peeks out from behind a wing.

THIEF
(0.S.)
...It's...wonderful!

JAFAR
Bring it to me!

THIEF
(0.S.)
I've got it! I've--AIIEEAUGGGH--

With a ROAR, the Tiger's mouth SLAMS DOWN--

JAFAR
NO!

Jafar leaps clear-- The Tiger's head begins to dissolve back into the sand--

TIGER-GOD
(fading)
SEEK THEE OUT...THE DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH...

--until only the sandstone outcropping remains. The scarab halves stop glowing, drop into the sand. Jafar stares. Iago surfaces, spits out sand.

IAGO
I can't believe it! We're never gonna get ahold of that tinpot lamp! Look at this--I'm so ticked off, I'm molting!

He flaps over to the outcropping.

JAFAR
I must have that lamp if I am to be Sultan.

IAGO
(kicks the outcropping)
And that stumblebum Gazeem has to go and get himself turned into cat food!

He picks up the scarab pieces, flaps back to Jafar, drops the Pieces into Jafar's hand.

JAFAR
A setback, Iago... not a defeat. Gazeem was not 'wise enough.'

IAGO
Big surprise there.
(scratches his head)
What else did that yakkin' pile of sand say? 'Only one may enter here?'

JAFAR
(musing)
Yes...I must find this one. This 'diamond in the rough...'

EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY

ALADDIN, wiry, shaggy hair, ragged clothes, runs for his life, clutching a loaf of bread. He skids to a stop at the edge of the building. Quite a drop.

GUARD
Stop, thief!

Aladain looks back--GUARDS scramble toward him. Aladdin puts the loaf of bread between his teeth, and LEAPS off the roof--
--trampolines off an awning--
--backflips toward a clothesline--
--lands on it, struggles to keep his balance--
--then falls, landing hard in a ceramic pot.

Guards on the roof wave their swords.

GUARD
You won't get away that easy!

ALADDIN
(beleaguered; half to himself)
You think that was easy?GUARD

Aladdin struggles to get out of the pot--suddenly the Head Guard, RAZOUL, looms over him, huge scimitar drawn--

RAZOUL
I'll teach you to steal from honest men!

ALADDIN
(low, a declaration of principle)
I steal to eat.

The blade slashes down--Aladdin kicks a window shutter in its path-- the blade gets jammed in the shutter--

Aladdin rocks the pot, tipping it over. It breaks; Aladdin scrambles free, runs down a side street

--where guards suddenly appear. Aladdin looks back--more guards rush toward him. He is surrounded.

ALADDIN
Abu!
(eying the approaching guards)
Abu...hurry it up....

Suddenly ABU, Aladdin's pet monkey, drops down, grabs Aladdin. He pulls Aladdin up--out of the path of the onrushing guards--

As they rise, we see that Abu has tied himself to a rope; they pass the counterweight (a big sack of flour) as it drops--

--nailing the guards in a powdery explosion. Aladdin and Abu land on the roof; Abu unties himself.

ALADDIN
Perfect timing, Abu!

Abu chatters 'no sweat!' But a guard appears on the roof--

ALADDIN
(to Abu)
I'll go high, you go low...

Abu slips between the guard's legs as Aladdin leaps over. Aladdin grabs the cloth of the turban and jumps, the unravelling turban slowing his fall as the guard is spun around--

Aladdin lands on a herd of sheep. Looks back. Guards wade after them, tossing sheep aside.

ALADDIN
(shakes his head)
How much do they pay these guys..?

Aladdin leaps over a fakir on a bed of nails--
The guards run the fakir over--
As Aladdin dashes past a sword swallower, he pulls the sword out of the swallower's craw--

ALADDIN
'scuse me--

He slashes a rope--a crate falls, pinning two guards--
Aladdin stabs the sword into a wall, pulis it back, lets it go:
THWAANG! it nails another guar Razoul tackles him hard, yanks him up by the wrist--

RAZOUL
I'll have your hand for a trophy, street rat!

ALADDIN
The name is Aladdin.

Pulling against Razoul's grip, he runs up Razoul's chest backflips to an awning.

ALADDIN
Show some respect!

Abu runs across the handles of knives on display, flipping them into the air--they narrowly miss the guards--

Aladdin runs along the awning--Razoul appears on the roof beside him. One of the guards below slashes the awning--the tear races toward Aladdin--

Aladdin falls through the awning, beneath Razoul's slash--

--onto carpet rolls. He runs across them--
Razoul leaps down to follow----gets his feet stuck in two rolls, like stilts--
Aladdin leaps from the rolls onto a plank, catapulting a snake charmer's basket onto Razoul--Razoul teeters--

--then falls into a camel wash--water roars through the square.

Aladdin and Abu watch from their high, safe vantage point. Abu chatters, 'I am beat.'

ALADDIN
(rueful)
All that for a loaf of bread...

He strains--the bread breaks with a snap. Aladdin makes a face.

ALADDIN
..._stale_ bread...

He tosses half to Abu. Abu gnaws on it. A scent catches his attention; he sniffs, following it. Looks down, into a window. at:
A family, sitting down to a large dinner. Aladdin also looks in.

ALADDIN
Yeah, Abu...that'd be the life...

He is looking at the people, chatting, laughing. Abu is looking at the food. Someone inside closes the shutters.

ALADDIN
Ah, forget it. This--
(gestures to include their surroundings)
--is the hand we were dealt. It'd take a miracle to change it...

Abu looks very sad. Aladdin realizes he is the cause. He tries to bolster Abu's spirit.

ALADDIN
But, hey, we're the greatest thieves in all of Agrabah! If we don't like the cards we've got-- we steal a new deck.
(Abu cheers up some)
We were meant for bigger things than scrambling for crusts of bread and sleeping in alleys...

Abu chatters 'go on...like what?!

ALADDIN
Well...how about when we walk through the marketplace, people say 'How may I help you, _Mr._ Aladdin, Mr. Abu?' And then we go home--to a _house_. With feather beds...and all the bananas you can eat.

Abu likes that. He glares at his half of the bread. Moves to throw it away--Aladdin stops him,

ALADDIN
But until then...we got to survive, right?

Abu shrugs, nods. Aladdin holds his half up. Abu taps his half against it, like clinking glasses.

ALADDIN
Count on me, Abu...Things are going to change.
(sings)
~HOLD ON
~THERE'S A RAINBOW
~THERE'S A SUNRISE
~THERE'S A DAWN
~HOLD ON
~I HEAR THE CALLING OF FATE
~THERE'S SOMETHING GREAT AND IT'S WAITING FOR YOU
~HANG ON
~TILL TOMORROW
~A NEW DAY IS DUE
~DID SOMEBODY ORDER MIRACLES FOR TWO?
~COUNT ON ME--I'LL COME THROUGH

As he sings, he and Abu go about finding a place to sleep. It is cold and lonely, and the best they can manage is a make-shift lean-to.

ALADDIN (CONT'D)
~AND WE'LL HAVE ADVENTURES
~IN MAGICAL PLACES
~A PRIVATE OASIS OUT THERE IN THE SANDS
~DIAMONDS AND RUBIES AND EMERALDS AND PEARLS
~A PALACE AND SERVANTS AND BEAUTIFUL GIRLS
~HOLD ON

~HAVE A DREAM, PAL
~HAVE A FEW
~DESTINY CALLS AND ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE
~HERE THEY COME--BRIGHT AND NEW
~DESTINY CALLS AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
~IS COUNT ON ME--I'LL COME THROUGH

They crawl into their lean-to. PULL BACK to show their plight: two little guys in a huge, dark city.

INT. PALACE - THRONE ROOM - MORNING

CLOSE ON: A mechanized miniature of the palace, the clockwork sun rising behind it.
The SULTAN, a roly-poly fellow, watches as: on a tiny balcony, a prince and a princess motor toward each other, kiss.

SULTAN
Oh, I just _know_ this suitor is the one Jasmine will fall in love with--

A resounding SLAM breaks the moment.

PRINCE ACHMED, in ridiculously ornate garb, stalks down the hall, furious, insulted. Part of his cloak is ripped.

ACHMED
I've never been so insulted. Good luck marrying her off!

SULTAN
Prince Achmed--you're not leaving so...soon, are you..?

But Achmed is out the door, another SLAM in his wake. The Sultan sighs, hurries out the way Achmed came in.

EXT. PALACE - GARDENS/MENAGERIE
The Sultan comes down the steps--

SULTAN
Jasmine!

--and is suddenly face-to-face with RAJA, a huge, menacing, growling tiger, fur bristling protectively. Part of Prince Achmed's cloak still in his mouth.

SULTAN
confound it, Raja--
(grabs the cloak)
So _this_ is why Prince Achmed stormed out!

Raja quickly drops his head and slinks back to-- PRINCESS JASMINE. She avoids the Sultan's eyes.

JASMINE
Actually, it was because I told him...I could never marry a man who dresses better than I do.

Raja snickers at this.

SULTAN
Dearest...you've got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call. The Law says you--

SULTAN/ JASMINE
must marry a prince by your sixteenth birthday.

JASMINE
Believe me, Papa--I know.

SULTAN
You've only got three more days!

She moves to one of the bird cages, takes out a bird, strokes it

JASMINE
Papa...I hate being forced into this. When I do marry, I want it to be for love.

SULTAN
Jasmine...it's not only this law...I'm not going to be around forever, and...well...I just want to make sure you're taken care of...provided for.

During this, he has taken the bird from her hands and locked it back in its cage.

JASMINE
But--I want more than that. I've never done anything on my own. I've never had any real friends--
(Raja growls in protest)
--except you, Raja. I've never even been outside the palace walls!

She looks at a reflection of herself in a pool of water.

SULTAN
But Jasmine--you're a princess--

JASMINE
Then maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore!

She splashes the water, destroying the reflection, stands, turning her back to the Sultan, who throws up his hands.

SULTAN
(to Raja)
Allah forbid you are ever blessed with a daughter!

*He hurries off.*
Jasmine turns enough to watch him go. She is sad--but then her expression changes to defiant resolve. She moves away--
And opens all the bird cages as she goes past.
Jasmine smiles, bittersweet, watching as the birds take wing.

INT. PALACE - THRONE ROOM - MORNING
The Sultan walks in, head down, depressed.

SULTAN
I don't know where she gets it from...her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

He looks at the table-top clockwork miniature of Agrabah, where the prince and princess again kiss.

SULTAN
If only the real world would run as perfectly...

A SHADOW falls on the model palace, extending across the map.

SULTAN (CONT'D)
Ah, Jafar....I am in desperate need of your wisdom.

We see the shadow is cast by-- Jafar, the dark man with dark purpose.

In the Sultan's presence, Jafar is self-effacing--but we can tell he hates this role.

JAFAR
My life is but to serve you, my lord.

SULTAN
It's this suitor business! Jasmine refuses to choose a husband. I am at my wits' end!

IAGO
wits' end!

SULTAN
(noticing Iago)
Have a cracker, pretty parrot?

Ne virtually stufts a cracker into the reluctant Iago's mouth. Iago chews it sullenly, crumbs dribbling from his beak.

JAFAR
You certainly have a way with dumb animals, sire.
(back to the point)
I believe I can divine a solution to your problem...

SULTAN
If anyone can help, it's you...my most trusted advisor.

JAFAR
I _will_ need the last Dragon's Eye Ruby...

The Sultan lifts his beard, revealing a necklace. Settings for a dozen stones--but only one is left.

SULTAN
But...oh...there's only one left...I don't know if I could part with it...

Jafar uses his snake's head staff to hypnotize the Sultan.

JAFAR
It is necessary to find the Princess a suitor. Don't worry...everything will be fine...

The Sultan's eyes reflect the glow of the Snake eyes.

SULTAN
(tranced)
.. everything will be...fine...

JAFAR
the Ruby?

SULTAN
Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be...fine.

He gives Jafar the Ruby. The glow fades.

JAFAR
You are most gracious, my liege. Now you can go play with your little toys, hmn?

SULTAN
Yes, that will be...pretty good!

He moves to his collection. Jafar spins, hurries on to his own task.

IAGO
(spits out cracker crumbs)
(imitates the Sultan)
'Have a cracker, pretty parrot.' Ptui! I can't take it anymore! If I gotta choke down one more slice of stale zweibeck--
(mimes punching the Sultan)
WHAM! I'm sick of stooging up to that feeb!

Jafar steps through a secret passage, begins climbing a winding staircase.

JAFAR
As am I, Iago.

Jafar holds the ruby up for examination, peers one-eyed through it. It magnifies his eye.

JAFAR (CONT'D)
But this will reveal to me the one who can enter the cave--and bring me the lamp.

At the top of the stairs, Jafar opens a door. Beyond is his lab, an alchemist 's playground: Beakers bubble, fires crackle.

JAFAR
We will be rid of both the Sultan and his daughter, soon enough.

He steps inside.

IAGO
(as though reading it up in lights)
Hizzoner, Sultan Jafar...Ooh. Doesn't that just roll trippingly off the tongue?

He chuckles 'heh, heh, heh, heh.' The door swings shut.

EXT. PALACE - GARDEN/MENAGERIE - DAY

Jasmine, in an old cloak, slips furtively to the palace wall. Starts to clamber up a tree--
Something tugs on her cloak, pulling her back. It is Raja.

JASMINE
I'm sorry, Raja, but I am not going to stay here and have my life auctioned off.
(tears in her eyes)
I'll miss you.
(she hugs him)

She moves Rajah to the wall. Climbs up onto his back, his head, to a tree, to the the top of the wall.

JASMINE
Good-bye...

She disappears over the side. Raja sadly paces, then lies down, head on paws.

INT. PALACE - TOWER - JAFAR'S SECRET LAB - DAY

Jafar conjures at a cauldron. Vapor rises from the potion, forms a cloud in the spherical steel-skeleton frame above him,

JAFAR
Faster, Iago!

Iago is harnessed to a wheel, running as hard as he can, generating energy, which feeds into the cloud.

IAGO
(panting)
Don't see why we can't... just wait for a real storm...

The cloud is big, black, menacing. Small bolts of lightning scrabble across it.

JAFAR
Save your breath, Iago.

Tne ruby is set in a frame above a large hourglass. Jafar gestures, invoking a spell.

JAFAR
Sands of time, I command thee-- Part and reveal the one who can enter the cave!

He turns the hour glass over. A LIGHTNING BOLT fires from the cloud. Strikes the Ruby. The Ruby flashes, disintegrates; a RUBY GLOW infuses the sand.

Iago is startled by the lightning flash--he looses his footing is whipped up into the mechanism, shocked and spit out.

The sand runs through the glass. A *contained sandstorm starts* in the glass' lower half. A picture begins to form.

IAGO
(smoke drifts from his beak)
The picture's always so grainy...

JAFAR
yes...yes!

The picture clears: it is ALADDIN, in the marketplace. Jafar leans Close.

JAFAR
So...this ragged urchin is my 'diamond in the rough.

IAGO
I figured he'd be taller...

JAFAR
Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we?

IAGO
Swell--I love a party.

MOVE IN on Aladdin in the hourglass--

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MARKETPLACE - AFTERNOON

Aladdin is atop a canopy which covers a fruit stand. Abu reaches own to steal a melon from a FRUIT SELLER--

FRUIT SELLER
Get your paws off that, you cursed filthy ape!

Abu chatters, 'kay.' Drops the melon. He was really cover for Aladdin, who swipes a melon from the other side.

In another part of the marketplace, Jasmine appears. She moves hrough, dazzled by sights brand new to her.

SELLER
Buy a pot, in brass or silver! I lose money at twice the price!

SELLER #2
Sugared dates! Sugared dates and figs! Or pistachios! Your taste buds will dance and sing!

SELLER #3
A pretty necklace for a pretty--

SELLER #4
FISH! FRESH FISH!

He shoves a fish in her face, causing her to back away--into FIRE EATER, who spews a stream of flame. Jasmine starts, her hood falling back from her head. Surprise turns to delight.

Aladdin spots her. Gasps. She is beautiful. Abu can't get Aladdin's attention. He clambers up onto his head, spots the distraction. Rolls his eyes.

Jasmine straightens her hood, continues her exploration. A kid staring hungrily at apples in a VENDOR'S cart. Jasmine hands him apple. The kid clutches it, runs off.

VENDOR
You'd better be able to pay for that! Jasmine starts, turns: a huge angry VENDOR is right in her face.

JASMINE
Pay..?

The Vendor can barely contain his anger; he grabs her hard.

VENDOR
_No one_ steals from my cart!

JASMINE
Please... If you let me go to the palace...I can get money from the Sultan--

The Vendor grabs Jasmine's arm.

VENDOR
Thief! Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?

He raises his knife menacingly--but Aladdin grabs his hand.

ALADDIN
Thank you, kind sir, I'm so Pleased you found her.
(to Jasmine)
I've been looking all over for you!

Jasmine is confused by this. The Vendor pushes Aladdin away.

VENDOR
You know this girl?

ALADDIN
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.
(he twirls his finger beside his head)
She's a little crazy.

Jasmine doesn't like the accusation. The Vendor smells a rat. He draws Aladdin close, fingering his knife.

VENDOR
She said she knew the Sultan.

Aladdin gestures toward Abu.

ALADDIN
(confiding)
She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

The Vendor considers this, but doesn't buy it. He makes a fist, draws back, ready to pound Aladdin--

JASMINE
0, wise Sultan. How may I serve you?

The Vendor looks: Jasmine is bowing to Abu, forehead to ground. Aladdin uses the distraction to swipe an apple.

Abu assumes a pompous, lordly air, pats Jasmine on the head. People laugh;. Aladdin offers the apple to the Vendor.

ALADDIN
See? No harm done.
(soothing)
Come along, sister. Time to go to see the doctor.

Jasmine follows obediently, pauses in front of a camel.

JASMINE
(to the camel)
Hello, doctor. How are you?

ALADDIN
Not that one. Come on...
(to Abu)
C'mon, Sultan,

Abu gives the crowd a lordly 'carry on' gesture--and drops several apples from behind his back.

VENDOR
Wha--?

Aladdin and Jasmine break into a run.

VENDOR
Come back here, you little thieves!

Abu grabs up the apples, races after them.

EXT. ROOFTOP - SUNSET
Jasmine climbs over a wall, not particularly gracefully.

ALADDIN (0.S.)
So...this is your first time in the marketplace, huh?

JASMINE
Is it that obvious?

Aladdin picks up a pole from an old, torn canopy.

ALADDIN
Well, you do kind of stand out...

Abu hanging onto him, he vaults over to the next rooftop. As he speaks, Aladdin picks up an old plank, lays it across to the other roof.

ALADDIN
I mean, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be--

Just as he finishes making the bridge, he is startled by-- Jasmine, following his lead, vaulting across.

JASMINE
I'm a fast learner.

She tosses the pole to him, strolls off. Aladdin looks at Abu--they're both a little amazed. Aladdin smiles, tosses the pole to Abu as he hurries after Jasmine.

ALADDIN
(taking the lead)
C'mon...This way.

He leads her through an archway. They are overlooking Agrabah. The palace dominant, beneath a gorgeous sunset. Breathtaking.

ALADDIN
Doesn't the palace look great from here?

He gazes out as she moves up beside him, She is downcast, remembering why she's out here in the first place.

JASMINE
Oh, yes...it's great.

Jasmine turns away from the view. Sits down.

ALADDIN
So where are you from?

JASMINE
It doesn't matter...I ran away, and I'm not going back.

ALADDIN
Really? How come?

JASMINE
My father is forcing me to get married.

ALADDIN
Oh. That's, uh...that's awful.
(genuine)
I wish I could help...

His sincerity affects her. She turns to look at him. He looks back at her...smiles tenderly. She returns it.

RAZOUL
(0.S.)
Here you are!

Jafar's Guards--led by Razoul--cross towards them.

JASMINE/ALADDIN
They're after me!
(beat)
They're after you?

JASMINE
Well, you see, my father--

ALADDIN
(cuts her off)
Do you trust me?

JASMINE
(not quite sure)
...yes...

ALADDIN

They leap off the terrace, bounce off a stable canopy, into a pile of hay. They scramble into the stables proper.

A guard slides off the canopy, thuds on the ground. He moves into the stable.

Aladdin, wedged between two ceiling beams motions 'get down' to Jasmine, who ducks her head, hidden in a pile of hay--the furthest one from the door

The Guard fills the doorway, scans the interior.

Abu ducks back into a disgruntled horse's feedbag.

The Guard smiles at the hay piles. He jabs his sword into one-- Aladdin watches--the guard is approaching Jasmine--

Inside the hay pile, Jasmine can hear the guard nearing--

The Guard is just about to jab Jasmine's hay pile--

ALADDIN
Hey! You looking for me?

The guard whirls. Aladdin drops from his hiding place. The guard attacks--Aladdin dodges, ducks--Jasmine peeks out, is impressed this boy is putting it on the line for her--

Aladdin is backed into a corner. The Guard attacks. Aladdin grabs the Abu-filled feedbag, stuffs it over the Guard's head. Screeches and yelps from inside the bag.

Aladdin bumps into something--Razoul. The rest of the guards are behind him.

RAZOUL
We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat?

The Guard pulls the bag off...pulls Abu off his face, hurls Abu aside, into an old earthenware jug.

RAZOUL
It's the dungeon for you, 'boy.

Jasmine leaps out, grabs Razoul by the arm.

JASMINE
Let him go! Let go!

RAZOUL
Looky here, men--a street _mouse_!

He shrugs her aside, sending her sprawling. The Guards laugh Jasmine stands up, fire in her eyes. Regally draws back the hood of her cloak.

JASMINE
Release him--By order of the Princess!

The guards draw back, shocked, even Razoul. They bow to her

ALADDIN
(stunned)
...the Princess...?

RAZOUL
Princess Jasmine...what are you doing outside the palace?

JASMINE
That's my affair. Do as I command...release him.

RAZOUL
Alas, Princess, I fear I cannot. my orders come from _Jafar_. You'll have to take it up with him.

They haul Aladdin off. Jasmine watches, scowling, determined.

JASMINE
(to herself)
Believe me...I will...

NERVOUS GUARD
Ahem.
(Jasmine looks at him)
May I escort you back to the palace, Princess?

Jasmine considers...then decides. She turns, throwing her hood back over her shoulder, whapping the guard in the face. She stalks off, toward the palace, the guard following.

A beat. Abu screeches from inside the earthenware jug. It topples over, shattering. Abu shakes his head, looks around. In the distance, he sees Aladdin being dragged to the palace.

INT. PALACE - JAFAR'S CHAMBER

Jafar slips into his quarters from a secret passage-- and Jasmine storms into the chamber, looking for him.

JASMINE
Jafar!

Jafar closes the passage door quickly...painfully pining Iago between the door and the jamb. Iago squawks.

JAFAR
Princess!

He spreads his robes, hiding Iago from Jasmine's view.

JAFAR
How may I be of service to you?

Jasmine moves in on him, angry.

JASMINE
The guards just took a boy from the market--on your orders.

SAFAR
(feigns puzzlement)
Your father _has_ charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah. The boy was a criminal.

JASMINE
(sharp)
What was his crime?

Unseen by Jasmine, Iago tries to wriggle out of the doorway. He tugs at Jafar's robe hem. Mimes begging.

JAFAR
Why, kidnapping the Princess, of course.

Jafar covertly kicks Iago back into the passage.

JASMINE
(appalled)
He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!

JAFAR
Oh...dear. How frightfully upsetting, Had I but known...

Jasmine waits, distraught, as Jafar milks the moment.

JAFAR
Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out...

JASMINE
What do you mean..?

JAFAR
Death...by beheading.

Jasmine draws back in horror. She is stunned.

JASMINE
(a whisper)
How...could you--

JAFAR
(reaches out to comfort her)
I _am_ exceedingly sorry, Princess...

She spins away from his touch, runs from the room. A beat. Jafar smiles, shrugs, a 'c'est la vie' gesture. Iago pushes the secret door back open.

IAGO
How'd it go?

JAFAR
I think she took that rather well.

EXT. PALACE - GARDENS/MENAGERIE - EVENING

Raja is looking, concerned and empathetic--
--at Jasmine, who is sobbing. Raja moves to her side, nose- nudges her questioningly. She looks up, teary-eyed, then hugs him, burying her face in his ruff.

JASMINE
...I didn't even know his name...

PAN UP the wall; Abu sticks his head up. Leaps to a palm, then to the ground, rustling a bush. Raja hears it, startled.

Abu moves through the shrubs. A low GROWL makes him pull up short. He turns slowly--

Raja is right there, huge teeth glinting.

Abu is terrified. He runs.

Raja searches for Abu. He moves past a statue, the classic 'SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL.' Abu has taken a fourth position: 'SMELL NO EVIL.'

Raja pauses, Sniffs suspiciously, coming closer to Abu--

JASMINE (0.S.)
Raja?

Raja turns in the direction of her voice...throws a last suspicious glance at the statue...then hurries off. Abu lets out his breath, relieved. Scampers away.

INT. PALACE - DUNGEON/TORTURE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Rats scurry across the gloomy walls, in and out of shafts of moonlight shining through a high, barred window.

Aladdin hangs slumped in defeat, supported only by the wrist « manacles that chain him to the wall of the dark chamber.

Abu's shadow appears on the wall; Aladdin looks up.

ALADDIN
Abu! Down here!

Abu chitters, scampers down. Aladdin pulls on the arm irons.

ALADDIN
Help me out of these...

Abu chatters, scolding Aladdin. He does a burlesque imitation of a woman--then makes a disgusted, dismissive gesture.

ALADDIN
What could I do? She was in trouble.

Abu begins to work on Aladdin's wrist cuffs.

ALADDIN
(CONT'D)
She was the Princess. I can't believe it.
(slumps)
She was terrific. For a while there, I was thinking that maybe she and I...

Abu chatters, warning him to forget her.

ALADDIN
(bitter)
Don't worry, Abu...there's a law. She has to marry a Prince.
(beat)
She _deserves_ a Prince.

Abu springs the lock. Grins, pleased. Aladdin does not share his elation; he looks around the dungeon.

ALADDIN
I'm a fool.

VOICE (0.S.)
You're only a fool if you give up, boy.

Aladdin starts, turns-- From out of the darkest corner of the dungeon a figure limps forward into the light: Jafar, disguised as a lame prisoner.

ALADDIN
(wary)
Who are you?

JAFAR
A lowly prisoner, like yourself. But _together_--perhaps we can be more...

ALADDIN
(suspicious)
I'm listening...

JAFAR
There is a cave, boy...a cave of wonders...filled with _treasures_ beyond your wildest dreams...

Abu lights up at this.

JAFAR (CONT'D)
(sly)
Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager...

The thought is appealing to Aladdin--but there's a problem--

ALADDIN
But the law says--

JAFAR
You've heard of the Golden Rule, haven't you? 'Whoever has the gold...makes the rules.'

ALADDIN
So why would you share all this wonderful treasure with me?

JAFAR
(indicates his own leg)
I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it.

Aladdin considers.

ALADDIN
It's fine to talk about... but I don't see how you're planning to get us out of here.

Jafar moves to a wail of the chamber. Iago peeks out from the hump on Jafar's back.

IAGO
(sotto)
Ya got 'em hooked...now reeeel him in!

JAFAR
(stuffs Iago away)
Don't be so hasty, boy. 'Things aren't always what they seem.

Jafar pushes in a particular stone. A section of the wall moves aside, revealing a staircase.

JAFAR
I can get what I want...and you can win the Princess. Do we have a deal?
(extends his hand)

Aladdin hesitates...looks at Abu. Abu is dubious. Aladdin looks back at Jafar... And then Aladdin shakes Jafar's hand. Jafar CACKLES and pulls him through the door. Abu hurries through before the door shuts.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

Riding camels, Jafar and Aladdin trek across the desert. Aladdin shields his eyes from a sand whipped wind from a distant storm.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DESERT - CAVE OF WONDERS LOCATION - NIGHT

Jafar and Aladdin are at the outcropping. The Tiger's head RISES FROM THE SAND.

Aladdin stares in awe. Abu peaks out of his hiding place in Aladdin's vest.

TIGER-GOD
WHO. DISTURBS MY SLUMBER?

ALADDIN
Uh, it's me...Aladdin.

BLINDING LIGHT from the cave. Aladdin winces.

TIGER-GOD
KNOW THIS! ONLY ONE MAY ENTER HERE
WHOM I DEEM WISE ENOUGH.
ONE WHOSE WORTH LIES DEEP WITHIN;
THE DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH.

Aladdin looks back at Jafar questioningly.

JAFAR
(urging him forward)

Remember, boy--bring me the _lamp_. And the treasure is _yours_!

Aladdin nods, steps toward the cave, Abu hanging on tight.

INT. CAVE OF WONDERS - FIRST CHAMBER

Aladdin and Abu descend warily. The stairs end in a beautiful chamber carved out of the stone. Tiled floor, finished walls.

On the walls are full-sized pictographs of human figures. They are all reaching for something. ...and they all have a frozen rictus of abject terror.

Aladdin barely notices--because at the far end of the chamber is a marble pedestal--and on the pedestal is a LAMP. large, bejeweled, its gold surface polished to a high sheen.

ALADDIN
(an intake of breath)
Oh...

Aladdin nears the pedestal. He moves to take the lamp--
--and catches sight of his reflection in the lamp: A DISTORTED FIGURE, REACHING OUT. Above it, on the wall is the _Thief_; he has become a pictograph on the wall, the latest in the long line.

Realization dawns. Aladdin draws his hand back. Abu chatters--what's the hang-up? He reaches for the lamp--Aladdin catches his wrists.

ALADDIN
No, Abu. I don't think that's the right one.

Suddenly, the lights go out. A RUMBLE--and a slit of golden light appears, forms into an arched doorway. Aladdin smiles. He steps through.

INT. TREASURE CHAMBER

A huge cavern filled floor-to-ceiling with all manner of fortune and treasure. Gold and emerald-encrusted pillars have been carved out of the very stone.

Aladdin surveys the riches in wonder.

Abu races to a large treasure chest-- ALADDIN
Abu! Don't touch anything.

--Abu pulls up short. But it looks so inviting...

ALADDIN
(certain)
We have to find the lamp first. The _real_ one.

Aladdin goes past. Abu gives the chest a final longing look, then follows Aladdin.

Suddenly the richly-woven (but very: dusty) golden-tasseled CARPET Abu has walked across COMES TO LIFE. It rises, follows them, floating above the ground.

Abu senses something, turns. The Carpet quickly lies flat.

Abu turns away. The Carpet follows. Abu spins back--but the Carpet has already become motionless. Abu scratches his head, tugs at Aladdin's shirt, trying to get his attention.

ALADDIN
Shhhh!

The Carpet has become more bold. It taps Abu on the shoulder, then ducks away. The peekaboo game continues until finally Abu and the Carpet come face-to-face. Abu screams, jumps back, all over Aladdin. The Carpet--equally terrified--zips away, hides behind a stalagmite.

ALADDIN
Abu--what--are you crazy?

Abu points frantically--Aladdin sees the carpet.

ALADDIN
(incredulous)
A... magic carpet!

The Carpet approaches Aladdin cautiously. Aladdin strokes it.

ALADDIN
*I'm not gonna hurt you...*

The Carpet zips around happily, sending up puffs of dust.

ALADDIN
You've been in here a long time, huh?
(The Carpet nods)
You're pretty dusty...
(the Carpet acts embarrassed)
Here, let me.

He grabs two of its corners, and shakes the dust off. The Carpet reels, a little disoriented--but then takes a look at itself.

Dust-free, it's a very pretty carpet. It preens.

ALADDIN
I guess your owner must've come looking for the lamp, huh?
(The Carpet nods)
That's why we're here, too...
(The Carpet points excitedly)
I think it knows where it is!

The Carpet zips off. Aladdin and Abu chase after it.

INT. LAMP CAVERN - NIGHT

The passageway opens into an immense cavern.

At the end of the cavern is a huge monolith, steps cut into its

face, surrounded by a pool. Stepping stones lead across. Atop it, in a beam of light, is the LAMP.

ALADDIN
You two wait here..

Aladdin hopscotches the rocks across the pool; Abu and the Carpet watch. Abu becomes aware of something, turns--

Not too far away sits a stone monkey idol. The monkey idol invitingly holds out a beautiful jewel. Abu reacts--'for me?'

Aladdin ascends the staircase toward the lamp.

Below, Abu has become transfixed by the monkey idol. Reaches for the jewel. The Carpet grabs Abu, holds him back.

At the top of the staircase, Aladdin looks through the light to see: _a dented, dust-covered, dull metal lamp_. Aladdin nods 'this is it.' Reaches for it...picks it up.

ANGLE ON: Abu, as he breaks free of the Carpet. Takes the jewel from the Monkey Idol.

ALADDIN
(to himself)
Now, why would that old man want this old thing..?
(spots Abu)
Abu! _No_!!

But it's too late. There is a faint RUMBLING sound in the distance. Dust falls from above. The ground begins to QUIVER.

TIGER-GOD
(0.S.)
_INFIDELS_! YOU HAVE TOUCHED THE
FORBIDDEN TREASURE! YOU ARE DOOMED!

Abu quickly puts the jewel back--to no avail--

ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE: The cavern SHAKES violently. The monolith stairway transforms into a chute--Aladdin clutches the lamp as he slides down the chute toward the pool--now transformed to boiling lava.

Just in time, the Carpet zooms in, catches him. They streak to grab up Abu, who is about to be crushed beneath falling' stone.

INT. TREASURE CHAMBER

The piles of treasure TRANSFORM into mountains of fire, the flames reaching up, scorching the carpet as they fly through.

INT. FIRST CHAMBER

The pictograph figures peel off the walls, wafer-thin creatures clutching after Aladdin, Abu and the Carpet. The three desperately avoid them as they make their way up the disintegrating stairway--

EXT. CAVE OF WONDERS

Outside, the earth TREMBLES. Winds SWIRL ferociously. Lightning FLASHES, thunder BOOMS. The Tiger's head ROARS as if in agony, Jafar watches, intently; Iago frightfully peers out from his cloak.

INT. CAVE OF WONDERS - STAIRWAY

A gigantic stalactite breaks off and pins the Carpet. Abu and Aladdin are thrown forward. A chasm opens, cutting them off from any chance of helping the carpet.

Aladdin and Abu scramble up to the entrance.

Abu makes it out. The ground gives way; Aladdin hangs by his fingers from the lip. Below him is a tremendously steep drop. Jafar appears above.

ALADDIN
(shouts over the din)
Help me!

JAFAR
Throw me the lamp!

ALADDIN
I can't hold on! Give me your hand!

JAFAR
First give me the lamp!

Aladdin fumbles for the lamp. Holds it out. Jafar snatches it away.

EXT. CAVE OF WONDERS

The earth SHAKES even more violently and the WINDS, LIGHTNING, and THUNDER accelerate. Jafar clutches the lamp with both hands, eyes gleaming.

JAFAR
(laughing)
YES!! At last!

Jafar turns and sees Abu helping Aladdin out from the entrance. Jafar pockets the lamp in his robe and pulls out a dagger. He kicks Abu aside and raises the dagger.

ALADDIN
What are you doing?!

JAFAR
Ending your miserable life, you stupid little urchin!

Abu leaps at Jafar and bites him hard in the arm. Jafar SCREAMS and drops the dagger. Jafar fights to extricate himself from the furious monkey. Iago is expelled, squawking, from Jafar's robes, Jafar viciously hurls Abu down through the entrance at Aladdin.

EXT. ENTRANCE
Aladdin and Abu drop back into the cave--

INT. THE CAVE

The Carpet finally manages to pull free of the stalactite. It zips toward the entrance--

As Aladdin and Abu hurtle down the steep drop, they crash into the Carpet on its way up. This breaks their fall; the three tumble down to the floor of the cave.

EXT. ENTRANCE

The EARTHQUAKE, and SANDSTORM build to a cataclysmic finale as the Tiger's head completely disintegrates and the plains of sand swirl around like a whirlpool.

Jafar reaches into his robe.

JAFAR
(chuckling)
It's mine! It's all mine! With the power of this lamp I will...

A horrified look comes over Jafar's face. He tears open the robe

JAFAR
Where is it?
(searches desperately)
No!

Jafar scrambles after the scarab pieces in the outcropping as everything vanishes into the sand.

There is a final FLASH of LIGHTNING and CRACK of THUNDER, then all is still and quiet. Jafar digs furiously, pulls out Iago, who sputters sand.

IAGO
Oh, thank you, your benevolence! I knew you'd save me!

JAFAR
No!

Jafar tosses Iago aside, continues digging. But there is no trace of the outcropping, or the scarab pieces.

JAFAR
This can't be! _It can't be_!

Iago scratches halfheartedly at the sand. We pull back to an EXTREME LONG SHOT of the tiny figure of Jafar on his knees, arms raised in torment.

INT. CAVE OF WONDERS

Aladdin comes to. Abu and the Carpet are on top of him. They stir groggily. Aladdin groans.

ALADDIN
...my head...

He looks up at the solid cavern ceiling.

ALADDIN
Trapped...
(despairing)
At least the dungeon had a window...
(slumps back)
That two-faced son of a jackal...whoever he is, he's probably long gone with that lamp...

Abu chatters--like a magician, he reveals: The Lamp. Aladdin is surprised...then he laughs.

ALADDIN
Abu!
(grins admiringly)
You little thief!
(takes the lamp)
This'll teach that old guy to mess with us!

Aladdin studies the lamp carefully.

ALADDIN (CONT.)
It's such a beat-up, worthless piece of junk.
(notices)
I think there's something written here... but it's hard to make out...

Aladdin rubs the lamp with his sleeve. It glows slightly--and then, POOF! Colorful smoke spews out of the spout. It eddies and swirls, filling the cave, taking shape and solid form--

Towering above Aladdin is the gigantic GENIE of the lamp. He is a hip, hyper, mercurial Robin Williams type, full of exuberance, with a child-like vulnerability.

GENIE
Oy! Ten thousand years will give you such a crick in the neck!

He CRACKS his neck, turning it completely around. Aladdin tries to speak but is cut off by the Genie.

GENIE
Hang on a second...Whaaa...wow! Does it feel good to get outta there! I'm telling you! Nice to be be back ladies and gentlemen. Hi, where you from, what's your name?

ALADDIN
(extremely wary)
Aladdin. But who are you--

GENIE
Aladdin! Hello, Aladdin, nice to have you on the show. Can we call you “Al”? or maybe just “Din”? or how 'bout “Laddie.” Sounds like here, boy!
(whistles)
come on, Laddie!

ALADDIN
(to the carpet)
I must've hit my head harder than I thought.

GENIE
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?
(Poof!)
HA HA HA HA! Sorry Bonzo! Hope I didn't singe the fur!

Abu is comically scared; the carpet laughs.

GENIE
(noticed the carpet)
Yo! Rugman! Haven't seen you in a few millenia--Gimme five!
(slaps hand-to-tassel)
(to Aladdin)
You're a lot smaller than my last master! Either that or I'm getting bigger! Look at me from the side, do I look different to you?

ALADDIN
Whoa--wait a minute. I'm--your _master_?

GENIE
That's right! He can be taught! What would you wish of me...the ever impressive, the long contained, the often imitated but never duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated..._Genie of the lamp_! Right here! Direct from the lamp! Right here for your very much wish fulfillment!

ALADDIN
(getting it clear)
_Wish_-fullfilment...

GENIE
Three wishes to be exact! No substitutions, exchanges or refunds!

Aladdin stares, deadpan.

ALADDIN
Now I know I'm dreaming...

GENIE
Master, I don't think you realize what you got here. So why don't you just ruminate whilest I illuminates the poss-o-bilities!

GENIE (CONT'D)
(sings)
~WELL, ALI BABA HAD THEM FORTY THIEVES
~SCHEHERAZADE HAD A THOUSAND TALES
~BUT MISTER YOU'RE IN LUCK CAUSE UP YOUR SLEEVES
~YOU GOT A BRAND OF MAGIC NEVER FAILS
~YOU GOT SOME POWER IN YOUR CORNER NOW

~AND I'LL SAY:
~MISTER
~ALADDIN SIR --
~WHAT WILL YOUR PLEASURE BE
~LET ME TAKE YOUR ORDER JOT IT DOWN
~YOU AIN'T NEVER HAD A FRIEND LIKE ME

As the Genie demonstrates his magical powers, the dark cave lights up and becomes his stage. The Genie changes his size, shape, and costume at will and creates a series of rapid-fire images, (an elaborate banquet, a bevy of beautiful harem girls,)
that shift around Aladdin, keeping him off balance.

GENIE (CONT'D)
~LIFE IS YOUR RESTAURANT
~AND I'M YOUR MAITRE 'D
~C'MON WHISPER WHAT IT IS YOU WANT
~YOU AIN'T NEVER HAD A FRIEND LIKE ME
~YESSIR, WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON SERVICE
~YOU'RE THE BOSS, THE KING, THE SHAH
~SAY WHAT YOU WISH, IT'S YOURS! TRUE DISH!
~HOW 'BOUT A LITTLE MORE BAKLAVA?
~HAVE SOME OF COLUMN A
~TRY ALL OF COLUMN B
~I'M IN THE MOOD TO HELP YOU, DUDE
~YOU AIN'T NEVER HAD A FRIEND LIKE ME

As the song escalates, the Genie creates more images: Slaves, armies, camels, horses, treasure, etc, filling the cave.

GENIE (CONT'D)
~CAN YOUR FRIENDS DO THIS?
~CAN YOUR FRIENDS DO THAT?
~CAN YOUR FRIENDS PULL THIS
~OUT THEIR LITTLE HAT?!
~CAN YOUR FRIENDS GO POOF
~WELL, LOOKY HERE!
~CAN YOUR FRIENDS GO ABRACADABRA LET 'ER RIP
~AND THEN MAKE THE SUCKER DISAPPEAR?
~SO DONCHA SIT THERE, SLACK JAWED, BUGGY-EYED
~I'M HERE TO ANSWER ALL YOUR MIDDAY PRAYERS
~YOU GOT ME BONA-FIDE, CERTIFIED
~YOU GOT A
~GENIE FOR YOUR CHARGE D'AFFAIRES
~I GOT A POW'RFUL URGE TO HELP YOU OUT
~SO WHATCHA WISH? I REALLY WANNA KNOW
~YOU GOT A LIST THAT'S THREE MILES LONG, NO DOUBT
~WELL ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS RUB LIKE SO
~AND OH --
~MISTER
~ALADDIN SIR
~WHAT WILL THOSE ORDERS BE?
~I DO MY JOB, YOU BIG NABOB
~YOU AIN'T NEVER HAD A FRIEND LIKE ME!

As the song concludes, all that the Genie has created WHOOSHES back into the lamp. The cave is empty again, save for Aladdin, Abu, the Carpet and the Genie.

GENIE
So...what'll it be, master?

ALADDIN
You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want. Right?

GENIE
That's it in a pistachio shell. BUT-- there are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quo.

ALADDIN
What?

GENIE
Uh, rule number one! I can't kill anybody! So, don't ask! Rule number two! I can't make anybody fall in love with anybody else!
(a big 'MWA!' kiss)
You little punim, you! Rule number three! I can't bring people back from the dead. It's not a pretty picture. I don't like doing it. Other than that, you got it!

ALADDIN
Provisos? You mean--limitations? On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.
(not impressed)
Can't even bring people back from the dead...
(to Abu)
I don't know, Abu...he probably can't even get us out of this cave!

Abu plays along with a dismissive gesture.

GENIE
Puh-leeese. Get with the program.

ALADDIN
Uh-huh...C'mon, Abu. Looks like _we're_ gonna have to find a way out.

GENIE
(insulted)
The gauntlet has been thrown: the gloves are off!

The Genie leaps onto the carpet, grabs Aladdin and Abu.

GENIE
Ladies and gentlemen and small primates-- Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet! In case of emergency, exits are here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, _anywhere_. WE'RE OUTTA HERE!

The Genie makes a gesture so huge it spins him around. With a resounding BOOM a crack appears in the cavern ceiling above; light pours through. The carpet spirals up and out--

EXT, DESERT - DAWN

--into the early morning sky. The Genie's uproarious laughter ECHOES as they soar away.

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

Jafar's head is bowed in abeyance as the Sultan lectures him. Jasmine stands beside the Sultan, arms crossed, cold fire in her eyes.

SULTAN
Jafar, if it weren't for all your years of loyal service...
(very harsh)
From now on, you're to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me-- before they are beheaded!

JAFAR
I assure you, your highness--it won't happen again.

SULTAN
Jasmine.,.Jafar...Now, let's put this whole messy business behind us...please?

JAFAR
My most abject and humblest apologies, Princess.

Jafar forces a smile. Jasmine is not soothed.

JASMINE
(low, to Jafar)
At least some good will come from my being forced to marry...When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of you.

She exits, out to the garden, The Sultan hurries after her.

SULTAN
Jasmine--he _apologized_. Doesn't that count for something?

They are both gone. Jafar stands there, teeth gritted, face reddening, seething. A volcano on the verge of eruption.

JAFAR
If only I had gotten that lamp...

IAGO
To think we gotta keep kowtowing to that dink and his dink daughter for the rest of out lives...

JAFAR
No, Iago...just until she finds a dink husband! Then she will have us banished!
(hand to throat)
Or beheaded!

Iago also puts his hand to his throat.

POV Iago - The garden. Jasmine speaks defiantly to the Sultan.

Iago gets an idea.

IAGO
Wait a minute, Jafar. What if..._you_ were the dink husband?

JAFAR
...what?

IAGO
You marry the princess! Then you become the Sultan!

JAFAR
Hmm...Marry the shrew...I become the Sultan...

Jafar settles onto the Sultan's throne as he considers it.

JAFAR
The idea has merit

IAGO
(acting it out, relishing it)
And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff. Aaaaaaaaa-- Ker-SPLAT!

EXT. OASIS - DAY

A patch of paradise in the barren desert. A watering hole for a few animals who are startled by the Carpet as it swoops down.

GENIE
Thank you for choosing the Magic Carpet for your travel needs. Don't stand until the rug comes to a complete stop...

The Carpet stops; Abu tumbles forward, into the water.

GENIE (CONT'D)
(smug, to Aladdin)
I sure hope I put to rest all that vicious nay-saying...

ALADDIN
Oh, yeah. He sure showed us, huh, Abu?

The Genie smiles--then it hits him. He snaps a look at Aladdin.

GENIE
Waaait a second.
(counts on his fingers)
Okay... you got out of the cave. Two wishes left.

ALADDIN
Ah...no...I never actually _wished_ to get out of the cave. You did that on your own.

The Genie begins to protest...stops. He gives Aladdin a slow sidelong, admiring smile.

GENIE
Well, you got me, kid...Boy, do I feel sheepish!
(turns to sheep)
But I'm warning you, you baaaad boy-- no more freebies!

Abu snaps his fingers 'darn!' Aladdin hops off the Carpet.

ALADDIN
Fair deal
(pacing, excited)
(the Carpet paces alongside him)
So...three wishes...I want them to be good.. .hmmm
(to Genie)
What would you wish for?

GENIE
(surprised)
Me? You're asking me for advice?

ALADDIN
It's not against the rules, is it?

GENIE
No, it's just no one's ever done it before....
(he muses)
Well, I guess you should wish for what you want most. For instance, in my case...oh, never mind. Forget it.

ALADDIN
What? What would you wish for?

GENIE
(sincere)
Freedom.
(rocketing on)
See, the only way I can escape this bargain-bin lamp is for my master to wish me free. So you can guess how often that's happened: the big goose egg--null set--nada-- we're talkin' zee-ro!

ALADDIN
You're a prisoner of this lamp?

The Carpet and Abu both peak inside the lamp--the Carpet lifts the lid, Abu peers down the spout.

GENIE
It's part and parcel of the whole Genie gig. Phenomenal cosmic powers, itty-bitty living space.

ALADDIN
(sympathetic, almost to himself)
A prisoner. That's really...

Abu finishes the sentence for him with a brief, grim chatter.

GENIE
You said it, furry guy. But--to be _free_...To be my own master! Such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world.
(beat)
But what am I talkin' about? Let's get real, it's not gonna happen! Genie, wake up and smell the humus!

Aladdin considers...then comes to an important decision.

ALADDIN
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

GENIE
(mimicking Aladdin)
I'll do it. I'll set you free.
Right !
(Pinnochio-nose grows)
Whoo-oop!

ALADDIN
Hey! I give you my word.

GENIE
(dubious)
The word of a thief.

ALADDIN
(a point of pride)
My word's the only thing I've got.

The Genie regards him speculatively.

GENIE
(a glimmer of hope)
You're not just pulling my chain?

ALADDIN
After I make my two wishes, I'll set you free.

The Genie considers.

GENIE
Fair deal.

He extends his hand. Aladdin takes it. They shake.

GENIE
Alright! Let's make some magic! So how 'bout it? What is it you want most? I showed you mine, you show me yours.

And suddenly Aladdin knows.

ALADDIN
Well, there's this girl...

GENIE
Ahh...I told you, Al--Romance, eet eez not my baggette.

ALADDIN
oh, yeah...right...But she's being forced to marry. I gotta help her...

The Genie evaluates him. Turns to Abu.

GENIE
He's really got it bad, huh?

Abu rolls his eyes, nods, dismisses the whole concept. The Carpet slaps him reprimandingly on the back of the head, looks at Aladdin, hands clasped over its breast
(it's soo romantic).

GENIE
This must be some girl...

ALADDIN
Oh, man, Genie...She's smart and fun and--

GENIE
Pretty?

ALADDIN
--beautiful
(inarticulate)
She's got this long, black...hair...And these _eyes_ ...and her smile...it's like...like...

GENIE
(picturing it)
_Wow_.

ALADDIN
(sighs, coming back to Earth)
She's the Princess. To even have a chance, I'd have to be...
(the light dawns)
Hey--can you make me a prince?

GENIE
Is that an _official_ wish? Say the magic words...

ALADDIN
Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!

The Genie whips out a huge cookbook titled 'ROYAL RECIPES.'

GENIE
Lessee...Chicken a la King... Alaskan King Crab...Caesar Salad-- yum,..Ah! How to Make a Prince!
(reading)
We're talkin' BIGTIME! We're talkin' GRAND POOBAH! Stand back! Gimme some room!

The Genie circles Aladdin like a clothes designer.

GENIE
First, the fez and vest combo is much too third century and those patches will have to go...

ALADDIN
Don't hold back--I don't want anyone to know who I really am.

The Genie unrolls fabric like a window shade, creating elegant robes for Aladdin.

GENIE
White is all the rage this season...

ALADDIN
Maybe a turban..?

GENIE
Feh on a turban. You need a _TURBAN_!

He inflates Aladdin's fez into a huge jeweled turban.

GENIE (CONT'D)
_Much_ better...Now you gotta have a mode of transportation...
(sees Abu)
Yo! Bonzo! Aqui!

Abu tries to slip away--he doesn't want any part of this.

GENIE (CONT'D)
And what better way to make your grand entrance down the streets of Agrabah than riding your very own... BRAND NEW _CAMEL_!!

He SNAPS his fingers. Abu transforms into a shocked camel.

GENIE (CONT'D)
Hmmm... Not enough... Abu becomes
(snaps; a maghificent stallion)
Still not enough...
(snapping fingers)
What am I thinking of..? It's right on the tip of my fingers. Ah ha!
Now we're talking!

As he speaks and snaps, Abu becomes various animals, finally turns into an elephant.

GENIE(CONT'D)

And just look at all that trunk space!

ALADDIN
Abu--you look good. _Different_...but good.

GENIE
Okay, he's got the outfit! He's got the elephant! But we're not through yet...!
(laughs maniacally)
Hang on to your turban, gonna make you a _STAR_!!

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

Jafar rushes in, a scroll in hand, Iago following.

JAFAR
Your Highness--I have found a solution to the problem with your daughter!

Jafar snaps out the scroll--it unrolls, draping over the Sultan, on his throne.

JAFAR (CONT'D)
Right here... 'If a princess has not chosen a husband by her sixteenth birthday--_then the Sultan shall choose for her_!'

The Sultan extricates himself.

SULTAN
But--Jasmine hated all of those suitors. How can I choose someone she hates?

JAFAR
Not to worry, my liege. There is more...
(he scrolls further)
...'if, in the event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess may then be wed to'--hmm. Interesting.

SULTAN
What? Who?

JAFAR
The Royal Vizier. That would be...me.

IAGO
That would be him!

Iago flinches, realizing his slip.

SULTAN
But--I thought--the law says that only a prince can marry a princess. I'm quite sure...

He paws through the scroll for verification. Jafar pulls it away from him, rolling it up quickly.

JAFAR
Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.
(uses staff to hypnotize Sultan)
And these are desperate times, aren't they?

SULTAN
...yes...desperate times...

JAFAR
You will order the Princess to marry me.

SULTAN
I will order the Princess to...
(shakes it off a bit)
--but you're so...old...

Jafar is affronted. He closes on the Sultan.

JAFAR
(brutal)
The Princess will marry me!

It is effective--the Sultan gasps, as though physically hit.

SULTAN
The Princess...will...marry-- marry...

Suddenly, from outside comes the instrumental vamp of 'Prince Ali.' The Sultan blinks, shakes his head. He gives Jafar a confused look, hurries to the balcony.

EXT. AGRABAH - MARKETPLACE - DAY
The crowd buzzes; heads turn as musicians round a corner.

MUSICIANS
~MAKE WAY FOR PRINCE ALI!
~SAY HEY, IT'S PRINCE ALI!

Throughout the song, the Genie infiltrates the crowd in various guises (an old man, a kid, a harem girl, etc.)

GENIE
~HEY! CLEAR THE WAY IN THE OL' BAZAAR
~HEY YOU! LET US THROUGH! IT'S A BRIGHT NEW STAR!
~OH COME! BE THE FIRST ON YOUR BLOCK
~TO MEET HIS EYE!
~MAKE WAY, HERE HE COMES, RING BELLS, BANG THE DRUMS!
~ARE YOU GONNA LOVE THIS GUY!

PRINCE ALI appears, dressed in elegant robes and turban, riding on a howdah atop the elephantine Abu. Ali is surrounded by an entourage of DANCERS, SWORDSMEN, and ATTENDANTS.

GENIE (CONT'D)
~PRINCE ALI! FABULOUS HE! ALI ABABWA!
~GENUFLECT! SHOW SOME RESPECT! DOWN ON ONE KNEE!
~NOW TRY YOUR BEST TO STAY CALM
~BRUSH UP YOUR SUNDAY SALAAM
~THEN COME AND MEET HIS SPECTACULAR COTERIE!
~PRINCE ALI! MIGHTY IS HE! ALI ABABWA!
~STRONG AS TEN REGULAR MEN--DEFINITELY!
~HE ONCE SLEW SEVENTY TURKS:
~MOUSTACHES, SABRES, REAL JERKS!
~WHO GAVE THOSE BAD GUYS THE WORKS? WHY, PRINCE ALI!

People swarm Ali; children run, dragging their parents. Merchants stop selling; harem girls swoon.

GENIE (CONT'D)
~HE'S GOT SEVENTY-FIVE GOLDEN CAMELS
~PURPLE PEACOCKS? HE'S GOT FIFTY-THREE!
~WHEN IT COMES TO EXOTIC-TYPE MAMMALS
~HAS HE GOT A ZOO?
~I'M TELLIN' YOU
~IT'S A WORLD-CLASS MENAGERIE!

GENIE AND CROWD
~PRINCE ALI! HANDSOME IS HE! ALI ABABWA!
~THERE'S NO QUESTION THIS ALI'S ALLURING
~NEVER ORDINARY, NEVER BORING
~THAT PHYSIQUE! HOW CAN I SPEAK
~EVERYTHING ABOUT THE MAN JUST PLAIN IMPRESSES
~WEAK AT THE KNEES?
~WELL, GET ON OUT IN THE SQUARE
~HE'S A WINNER, HE'S A WHIZ, A WONDER
~ADJUST YOUR VEIL AND PREPARE
~HE'S ABOUT TO PULL MY HEART ASUNDER
~TO GAWK AND MARVEL AND STARE
~AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE WAY HE DRESSES!
~AT PRINCE ALI!

The entourage sweeps through the Palace gates.

EXT. PALACE COURTYARD - DAY

Aladdin on Abu and the crowd surge toward the Throne Room.

GENIE AND CROWD
~HE'S GOT NINETY-FIVE WHITE PERSIAN MONKEYS
~HE'S GOT THE MONKEYS, LET'S SEE THE MONKEYS
~AND TO VIEW THEM HE CHARGES NO FEE
~HE'S GENEROUS, SO GENEROUS
~HE'S GOT SLAVES, HE'S GOT SERVANTS AND FLUNKIES
~PROUD TO WORK FOR HIM
~THEY BOW TO HIS WHIM
~LOVE SERVIN' HIM
~THEY'RE JUST LOUSY WITH LOYALTY
~TO ALI!
~PRINCE ALI!

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

Huge doors burst open as Aladdin and his entourage enter the gigantic Throne Room. The Sultan watches with delight.

GENIE, BAND, CROWD
~IT'S ALI! AMOROUS HE! ALI ABABWA!
~HEARD YOUR PRINCESS WAS A SIGHT LOVELY TO SEE!
~AND THAT, GOOD PEOPLE, IS WHY
~HE GOT DOLLED UP AND DROPPED BY
~WITH SIXTY ELEPHANTS, LLAMAS GALORE,
~WITH HIS BEARS AND LIONS, A BRASS BAND AND MORE
~WITH HIS FORTY FAKIRS,
~HIS COOKS, HIS BAKERS,
~HIS BIRDS THAT WARBLE ON KEY
~MAKE WAY FOR PRINCE ALI!

Genie, his work done, surreptitiously zips back into the lamp, which Aladdin has hidden under his turban.

Aladdin floats down on the carpet from Abu's back.

ALADDIN
(his voice deeper)
(bows low)
Your Majesty...I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand. Allow me to present myself. I am--

SULTAN
Prince Ali Ababwa! Of course! delighted to meet you. This is my Royal Vizier, Jafar. He's delighted, too.

Aladdin raises an eyebrow--Jafar looks familiar.

JAFAR
Ecstatic. Hearing the voice, Aladdin recognizes him. He spins away, hiding his face.

ALADDIN
(trying to cover)
And this is--is-- Abu, too, has recognized Jafar. His knees are shaking.

ALADDIN
--my pet elephant, Ab--uh, Abigail. Abu looks miffed--then smiles weakly, curtseys.

ALADDIN
(sotto, to Abu)
The guy from the cave! We're dead. He's gonna recognize us-- A miniature Genie slips down from Aladdin's turban.

GENIE
(sotto)
Hey, Al--Don't get your sash in a knot, Trust the magic!

He re-hides. Aladdin takes a deep breath, turns back, resuming his prince attitude-- Jafar--and Iago--are staring at him coldly.

JAFAR
I'm afraid, Prince. ..Abooboo--

ALADDIN
Ababwa.

JAFAR
...whatever. You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to--

SULTAN
(examines the Carpet)
What a wonderful device! May I--?

He gestures 'take it for a spin?!

ALADDIN
Why, certainly, your Majesty... Allow me

He helps the Sultan to sit on the Carpet.

JAFAR
Sire--I must advise against this! These cheap parlor tricks can be quite dangerous.

IAGO
Cheap! Cheap!

SULTAN
Oh, button up, Jafar. Learn to have a little fun.
(the carpet lifts)
Amazing!

It's a little precarious--the carpet must rescue him once--but the Sultan gets the hang of flying. Does a loop.

JAFAR
(to Aladdin)
Just where did you say you were from...?

ALADDIN
Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure...

JAFAR
_Try_ me...

The Sultan buzzes him. Iago squawks, goes aloft. The Sultan chases him around the room, laughing. Iago does not enjoy it. The Carpet comes in for a landing. It stops, forms a slide. The Sultan dismounts with a flourish, having done no work at all.

JAFAR
Spectacular, your Highness.

SULTAN
Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it...

SULTAN (CONT'D)
(considering Aladdin)
This is a very impressive youth-- and a prince, besides...
(sotto, to Jafar)
If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all...

Jafar is aghast--covers it quickly.

JAFAR
(sotto, to the Sultan)
I don't trust him. He seems... duplicitous.

SULTAN
Nonsense! One thing I pride myself on, Jafar--I'm an excellent judge of character.
(very sure)
Jasmine will like this one.

ALADDIN
(a private smile)
And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine...

JAFAR
Your highness--No! I must intercede-- on the poor girl's behalf.

Unnoticed, Jasmine, Raja behind her, has entered from the garden. Aladdin's back is to her.

JAFAR
This boy is no different from the others. He has nice _things_--but possessions are not the measure of  aman! What makes him think he is worthy?

ALADDIN
(very confident)
I am Prince Ali Ababwa! Sultan, just let her meet me--I will win your daughter!

JASMINE
How dare you! I am no prize to be won!

Aladdin spins. Jasmine turns on her heel, strides out.

IAGO
No prize...to be won!

Raja pauses. He sniffs the air suspiciously. Aladdin is crestfallen.

SULTAN
Er...don't worry, Prince Ali. My daughter is a bit...independent. Give her time to cool down, and I'm sure she'll warm to you...

JAFAR
(sinister, to Iago)
I will make certain he never has the time...

Raja has sniffed up to Abu. He growls. Abu turns to face him-- and is terrified. Abu trumpets, and stampedes--

The dust settles. Only a pleased Iago is left standing.

Abu clings to a chandelier, treed by Raja.

SULTAN
Your elephant seems a bit high- strung.

ALADDIN
Er...he's allergic to cats...

The chandelier cable snaps. Abu plummets--onto Iago.

EXT, MENAGERIE - NIGHT

P.0.V., ALADDIN, looking up toward Jasmine's balcony, above the menagerie. Jasmine gazes out toward the horizon. She turns, disappears inside.

ALADDIN (0.S.)
First that old guy turns out to be the Royal Vizier...Now Jasmine won't even let me talk to her...

Aladdin paces in the menagerie. Abu watches the Genie and the Carpet play chess. The Carpet makes a move, sits back, smug.

ALADDIN
I should have known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish...

GENIE
Maybe it's time to go for wish numero two-o..?

Aladdin makes a dismissive gesture. The Genie examines the chessboard, downcast.

GENIE
I can't believe I'm losing to a rug...

Abu notices he's at eye-level with a banana tree. He takes a whole bunch in his trunk, squeezes it into his mouth. Takes another.

ALADDIN
(to Genie)
What am I going to do?

GENIE
Al, I been around awhile, and I'll tell you: The first rule in the game of love is--
(turns the chessmen into checkers)
--there are no rules!

He executes a multi-jump, wipes the agog Carpet's checkers from the board.

GENIE
What you got to do is go see her.

ALADDIN
I told you--she refuses—-

GENIE
Refuses to see _Prince Ali_.
(takes turban)
But would that stop that scrappy little second-story man from the backstreets of Agrabah? I think not!

ALADDIN
(takes turban back)
If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy...street rat...
(downcast)
...She'd laugh at me.
(dons turban)

GENIE
(turns turban into a lamp shade)
A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh.

The turban melts, reforming into the Genie.

GENIE
Listen...Aladdin. You really ought to be yourself.

Aladdin considers--shakes his head.

ALADDIN
That's the last thing I want to be.

Aladdin steps onto the carpet, dons his cape.

ALADDIN
How do I look?

The Genie regards him a little sadly. Gestures--the turban is restored.

GENIE
(false good humor)
Like a Prince...

Aladdin smiles. The Carpet rises, The Genie watches it go.

Something catches his attention: Abu, lying on his side, bloated, beside a huge pile of banana peels.

INT. JASMINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jasmine dangles yarn for Raja, who bats at it.

ALADDIN (0.S.)
Princess Jasmine...

Jasmine looks out, onto the balcony.

EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT

JASMINE
Who's there?

ALADDIN
It's me, Prince Ali--
(remembers Prince Ali voice)
...Prince Ali Ababwa.

JASMINE
I do not want to see you!

She turns to go inside. He moves after her, so the room light illumines him.

ALADDIN
(in real voice)
Please, Princess--give me a chance--

He draws up short--Raja has stepped in front of him. Jasmine turns back to him. He's closer to her now.

JASMINE
Just leave me alone--
(starts; peers at him)
Have we met before?

Aladdin's eyes go wide. He steps back, away from her, into the shadows. Raja advances on him, backing him clear to the rail.

ALADDIN
Uh...no, no.
(remembers his role)
Although you may well know me by my reputation. Prince Ali? Ababwa?

Jasmine steps closer.

JASMINE
You remind me of someone I met in the marketplace...

Aladdin strikes an Ali-casual pose to avoid her scrutiny.

ALADDIN
The marketplace? Ha, Ha. I have _servants_ who go to the marketplace for me.

Jasmine scowls. The Carpet holds its head, shakes it.

ALADDIN
Why, I have servants who go to the market for my servants. So it couldn't have been me you met...

JASMINE
(losing interest)
No. It couldn't be.

Beside the Carpet, the Genie appears as a bee.

GENIE
How's our little beau doing?

The Carpet makes a throat-slitting gesture. The Genie shakes his head. Flies toward the balcony.

GENIE
(grumbling)
...can't believe it...he's never gonna free me at this rate...gotta do everything

JASMINE
Funny, isn't it? How some people mistake having things...with having character.

The Genie flies up near Aladdin, who absently shoos him away.

ALADDIN
Yeah...those fools.

GENIE
Bzzzt!

Aladdin looks over. Is startled.

GENIE
Talk about _her_...

Aladdin isn't sure. The Genie gestures 'go on!'

ALADDIN
Princess--Jasmine...You're very, uh, very beautiful. Jasmine rolls her eyes. Then she turns toward him.

JASMINE
I'm rich, too, you know.

ALADDIN
yeah...

She moves closer, seductively.

JASMINE
The daughter of the Sultan.

ALADDIN
I know.

JASMINE
A fine prize for any prince to marry...

ALADDIN
(very happy)
...right. A prince like me.

JASMINE
Right. A prince like you...and every other stuffed-shirt, swaggering peacock I've met. Go... jump off a balcony!

She strides toward her chamber. Aladdin is stunned.

GENIE
Stop her--and beeeeeeee yourself!

ALADDIN
(eyes Raja)
Yeah, right.

JASMINE
What?

ALADDIN
(covering)
Uh...you're right.
(genuine)
...that you aren't just some prize to be won. You should be free to make your own choice.

Jasmine is surprised. She turns, reappraising Aladdin.

ALADDIN
I'll go now.

She starts to say something ('wait a second') -- Aladdin steps dejectedly off the balcony rail, into space.

JASMINE
No--!

Her cry startles Aladdin. He whirls--from Jasmine's POV, he seems to be floating in space.

ALADDIN
What? What?

Jasmine moves forward, amazed.

JASMINE
How...how are you doing that?

As he speaks, the Carpet rises to reveal itself.

ALADDIN
It's, uh, a magic carpet.

Jasmine moves to the balcony rail, touches the Carpet.

JASMINE
It's lovely...
(the Carpet blushes)
I've never seen a magic carpet before.

ALADDIN
You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride--do you?

Jasmine does not reject the proposal.

ALADDIN
You can pretend I'm not-even there-- I won't say a word.

This provokes a puzzled half-smile from Jasmine. Aladdin extends a hand to her. The Carpet creates steps for her.

JASMINE
(still reluctant)
Is--it safe?

ALADDIN
Sure...Do you trust me?

Jasmine is startled: this is just what Aladdin had said to her earlier.

JASMINE
(perplexed)
...yes...

Aladdin takes her hand--

ALADDIN
Then--Jump!

He pulls her up, onto the Carpet. The Carpet immediately rockets up into the sky. Raja watches them go. The Genie re-appears.

GENIE
(to Raja)
sit!
(Raja sits)
Good kitty!

He vanishes. Raja spins, looking for the source of the command.

EXT. AGRABAH — NIGHT

Jasmine throws her arms around Aladdin, a little frightened by the flight. They become aware of their proximity...Release each other, a little embarrassed--but pleased.

Jasmine looks down, sees a breathtaking view of the Palace in the moonlight. Beyond is the city of Agrabah.

JASMINE
Where are we going?

ALADDIN
Someplace special.
(sotto, to the Carpet)
Take us someplace special.

The Carpet gestures 'no problem,' sweeps them off--

In a romantic, picturesque MUSICAL MONTAGE we follow Aladdin and Jasmine as the Carpet takes them on a magical tour.

The Carpet takes them down, amongst a herd of running horses. Aladdin turns it into a race, urging the carpet ahead. Jasmine cheers when they pull ahead of the lead horse--then strokes the surprised horse's mane, waves 'bye-bye' to it.

They sweep past the pyramids, around the Sphinx. A worker is startled by the Carpet; his hammer blow misses the chisel, and the Sphinx's nose crumbles away.

They cruise past Grecian temples, over a still pond. The Carpet whips quickly through the tree branches--creates a cascade of falling blossoms. Then moves slowly through the cascade, near to the water. Jasmine trails a hand on the surface; the Carpet flies an intricate pattern--the wake left by Jasmine's trailing hand makes a beautiful design.

The carpet follows the terrain of the land, rising up over a hill -- and before them is the Great Wall of China. They both look at it in shared wonder.

EXT. FORBIDDEN CITY - NIGHT

Aladdin and Jasmine are perched atop a building against a background of twinkling stars. The Carpet sits away from them, nearer to the roof's edge, dangling its feet, applauding the-- FIREWORKS from a street festival. MUSIC can be heard.

Jasmine regards Aladdin, who watches the fireworks.

JASMINE
(casual)
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

ALADDIN
Nah...he hates fireworks. He doesn't really like flying, either--

His eyes go wide--he realizes what he just said. The Carpet glances back, slaps its forehead ('what a gaffe!').

ALADDIN
...ah...that is...
(looks down)
...ho-boy...

JASMINE
(angry)
You are the boy from the market-- I knew it! Why did you lie to me?

ALADDIN
Jasmine, I'm sorry--

JASMINE
Did you think I was stupid?--

ALADDIN
(aghast)
No!

JASMINE
--that I wouldn't figure it out?

ALADDIN
No...I mean, I _hoped_ you wouldn't-- that's not what I meant--

JASMINE
Who are you? Tell me the truth.

ALADDIN
The truth? The truth...

He's a little panicky--but then, he makes a decision. The Carpet leans forward, very interested in his answer.

ALADDIN
(quickly)
The truth is I sometimes dress up as a commoner, to escape the pressures of palace life.
(nods to himself)
Yeah. But I really am a prince.

JASMINE
Why didn't you just tell me?

ALADDIN
Well, you know...Royalty, going out to mingle with the common people...It sounds a little strange.

Jasmine is sympathetic to the reasoning.

JASMINE
...not that strange.

A beat. She reaches out, touches his hand. He takes hers. They smile at each other. She turns back to watch the fireworks. Aladdin rolls his eyes, blows out an inaudible breath--he's relieved.

The Carpet watches them, lying on its belly, head lolling on its interlaced fingers, a little moony over the romance.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT

The Carpet hovers; Aladdin heips Jasmine off, onto her balcony. They both seem very pleased. She hugs him suddenly--he's a bit surprised, but he likes it.

JASMINE
I'm so glad you're not dead!

ALADDIN
Me, too...
(frowns)
Who said I was dead? And then he realizes, says it at the same time she does.

JASMINE/ALADDIN
Jafar.

JASMINE
Be very careful around him. He can't be trusted.

ALADDIN
I figured as much. Don't worry-- I can handle him.

JASMINE
Yes...I believe you can...

He likes the sound of that. They stare into each other's eyes. Drift slightly toward each other, hesitatingly. Look some more into each other's eyes...

Finally, the Carpet, impatient, does a small roll under Aladdin, bumping him up into a kiss with her.

Aladdin and Jasmine break the kiss: we see that they are obviously both affected by it. Jasmine recovers first.

JASMINE
Good night...my handsome prince...

Aladdin beams.

ALADDIN
Sleep well, Princess...

Jasmine turns and enters her chamber. The curtain falls. Aladdin makes a triumphant gesture.

EXT. MENAGERIE - NIGHT

Aladdin steps off the Carpet. The Genie meets him, avid for details.

GENIE
So how'd it go? Don't keep me in suspense. Was it the thrill of victory, or the agony of defeat?

ALADDIN
(elated, excited)
It was great!

The Carpet settles beside the sleeping Abu, stretches mightily, and goes to sleep.

ALADDIN (CONT'D)
She likes me. She called me 'handsome.' 'Her handsome prince.' Wow.

GENIE
Whoa, time out. You didn't tell her the truth?

ALADDIN
(ashamed)
Well, technically...no.
(defensive)
But she wouldn't have liked me! She likes Prince Ali!

GENIE
I think you're underestimating her...Al--pal--I'm usually the last one to bad mouth magic--
(points at the Carpet)
I mean, some of my best friends are magic...but I've seen it wreck homes, ruin lives--you can't let it control you. You can't let it change you.

ALADDIN
Look--you said romance wasn't your thing, remember? Everything's going fine...

A rustling in the bushes startles Aladdin and the Genie.

ALADDIN
(sotto)
Quick--hide! Get in the lamp!

GENIE
(zips into lamp)
I'm smoke!

Aladdin slips the lamp into his robe. He creeps into the bushes, investigating. Rounds a corner, sees-- Jafar.

JAFAR
I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo.

Suddenly, Aladdin is GRABBED from behind by Razoul and another guard. Manacles are snapped on his wrists. His legs. A gag is stuffed in his mouth.

JAFAR
I have already claimed the princess as my own.

Aladdin reacts; struggles to break free. Razoul knocks him out.

JAFAR
Make sure he is never found.

RAZOUL
Yes, your eminence.

He and the other guard drag Aladdin away.

IAGO
Poor Prince Ali...well, life has its ups...and _downs_!

EXT. SEA - COASTLINE - NIGHT

Aladdin is tossed from a high cliff by the guards. He hits the water, disappears--

UNDERWATER, Aladdin sinks quickly. He revives, recognizes his bad situation--

He draws his knees in, struggles to bring his manacled arms around, to in front of his body. Succeeds. Still going down.

He reaches into his jacket, pulls out the lamp--hard to maneuver with his hands chained, but he's got it--

He hits a jagged reef--loses the lamp. He sees it sinking away from hin. Looks up--

POV ALADDIN: the surface is very distant, moon shining down--

Aladdin is dizzy, running short of air. The lamp lodges on the ocean floor.

Aladdin kicks off, goes after it, desperate.

He reaches it, grabs it feebly. Can barely rub it.

The Genie appears, in a shower cap, holding a scrub brush and a rubber duckie.

GENIE
Never fails, get in the bath and there's a rub at the lamp--

He sees Aladdin, drowning. This is no joking matter; the props vanish.

GENIE
Al! Make a wish! 'Genie, I want you to save my life!'
(no response)
You gotta tell me--do you wish for me to save your life?
(he_shakes him)
C'mon, Aladdin--

Aladdin nods, barely.

GENIE
(going into action)
Good enough!

He creates a whirlpool that takes them to the surface-- --then becomes a waterspout as they break through.

As the waterspout rises: Aladdin looks pretty bad. The Genie gestures--

The chains and gag disappear. Aladdin comes to with a start. He looks up, realizes what has happened. Aladdin touches the Genie's arm.

ALADDIN
Thanks, Genie.

The Genie smiles gently, nods.

GENIE
When your life passed in front of your eyes, I hope you got my good side.

ALADDIN
I have to get back to the palace...

Razoul and the second guard lead a camel down from the cliff's edge, heading home.

The waterspout crashes down, avoiding the camel, and washes the two guards out, back over the cliff. Aladdin leaps aboard the camel, spurs it to a gallop.

INT. JASMINE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Jasmine, smiling dreamily, unbraids her hair. The Sultan enters. Unseen by Jasmine, Jafar is behind him. The Sultan is tranced. Jafar's snake-staff's eyes glow each time the Sultan speaks.

JASMINE
Papa! I just had the most wonderful time...with a wonderful boy. I feel so happy!

SULTAN
(tranced)
You should be, Jasmine...I have chosen a husband for you...

JASMINE
What?

SULTAN
You will wed...Jafar...

Jasmine gasps. Jafar steps forward, to where she can see him.

JAFAR
Speechless, my dear? Would that you remain this way for the duration of our marriage...

JASMINE
I will never marry you! Papa-- choose Prince Ali!

JAFAR
Prince Ali left, as you wished. Don't worry--wherever he went, I'm sure he made quite a splash.

IAGO
Quite a splash!

JASMINE
Papa, Ali wouldn't have left!

SULTAN
Jafar...always tells the truth.

JASMINE
He's lying! I know it!

JAFAR
And can you prove it?

ALADDIN (0.S.)
I can!

He stands in the doorway, recovered from his ordeal. Iago has a near-cardiac arrest. Jafar is stunned, then frowns, suspicious.

ALADDIN
Jafar ordered me to be killed!

JAFAR
(recovering)
Sultan, surely you don't believe him over me?

The Genie appears, unseen. He scowls, sensing something.

GENIE
(sotto, to himself)
Someone's doing magic here--and it's not _me_... The Genie spots the snake's glowing eyes.

GENIE
(very alarmed)
Uh-oh!

SULTAN
Jafar...always tells the truth...

JASMINE
Papa...you've got to believe us!

The Genie, very small, pops in beside Aladdin's ear.

GENIE
Al--the staff!

Jafar starts, then stares, mouth agape--_he's seen the Genie_.

SULTAN
Jasmine will wed...Jafar... Aladdin leaps across the room, wrests the staff from Jafar.

ALADDIN
Maybe this will change his mind!

He smashes the head of the staff against the floor. Jasmine stares as a green glow drifts up from it. An identical green glow also emerges from the Sultan's eyes.

SULTAN
Oh...oh, my...what's wrong with
(he remembers)
(angrily)
_Jafar_! You..._traitor_!

Jafar shoves Aladdin aside, grabbing back the shattered staff.

JAFAR
(a hiss)
This is not done yet, boy!

Aladdin leaps at him. Jafar throws down a smoke pellet. Aladdin continues through, tackling only his cape. Jafar is gone. Jasmine helps Aladdin up, embraces him.

JASMINE
Are you all right?

ALADDIN
(enjoying the contact)
I am...now.

SULTAN
Jafar...my most trusted . friend...plotting against me all this time...This is horrible, just horrible...

He notices Jasmine and Aladdin. Rubs his eyes, gapes.

SULTAN
Can this be true? My daughter has chosen a suitor?

Jasmine smiles at him, nods.

SULTAN
I knew it!
(he hugs Aladdin)
Oh, you brilliant boy! I'd kiss you-- but I'll leave that to my daughter.
(Aladdin beams)
You two will be wed at once! You'll be happy, and prosperous...and then you will become Sultan!

ALADDIN
(surprised)
Sultan?

We PUSH IN on Aladdin.

SULTAN (0.S.)
--and ensure the happiness of all the people of Agrabah for all of your days!

Aladdin falters; he looks worried.

INT. JAFAR'S LAB - NIGHT

Iago, panicky, precedes Jafar in from the secret passage. Jafar slams the door, tries to catch his breath. Iago races around, grabbing stuff: beaker, comb, bag of parrot seed.

IAGO
I'll start packing--only essentials. We gotta travel light...

Jafar LAUGHS, a bit madly. Iago stares, amazed.

IAGO
(shakes his head)
Oh, geez...he's cracked. I could see it coming...
(grabs Jafar by the collar)
Jafar! C'mon! Get a grip!

Jafar grips him by his throat.

IAGO
(strangled)
--I didn't mean it that way--

JAFAR
Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin Aladdin!
(loosens his grip)
He has the lamp, Iago.

Iago's eyes go wide with realization.

IAGO
(mumbling)
Why...that little, two-faced, lying, cheating...

JAFAR
But you are going to relieve him of it.

IAGO
_Me_?

JAFAR
Yes, Iago--you. Now, listen closely. You must choose your moment wisely...

INT. ALADDIN'S SUITE - DAWN

Aladdin enters, head down, preoccupied. Strips off his jacket and turban, the lamp inside. The Genie pops out of the lamp.

GENIE
Huzzah! Hail the conquering hero! Aladdin! You've just won the heart of the princess! What are you going to do next?

Aladdin scowls at him. The Genie waits a beat.

GENIE
(stage whisper)
Your line is 'I'm going to... free the Genie!'

At the window, Abu and the Carpet look on happily. Aladdin can't meet his eye. The Genie's no slouch; he senses what must be coming.

ALADDIN
Genie...
(can't look at the Genie)
I can't.

GENIE
Sure you can! You just go--
(moves Aladdin's mouth)
'Genie, I wish you free.'

ALADDIN
(pushes hand away)
I'm serious!

Abu and the Carpet look at each other sadly. The Genie slouches. He is crushed. Aladdin turns to him.

ALADDIN
I'm sorry! I really am. But I can't be Sultan! I'm not fit to be Sultan!

GENIE
Al--you won! You snatched victory from the jaws of defeat! Good has triumphed over evil!

ALADDIN
I couldn't have done it without _you_! _You_ did it! What happens if I'm Sultan and something really horrible happens? Or--what if Jafar comes back? I need to keep my third wish.

The Genie shakes Aladdin's hand off.

GENIE
Fine. I understand. After all, you've lied to everyone else. Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.
(he lets it sink in)
Now. If you'll excuse me--_master_.

He disappears into the lamp. Aladdin rests a hand on it.

ALADDIN
Genie...I'm really sorry.

The lamp spout raspberries Aladdin. Aladdin's taken aback--and then angry. Grabs up the lamp.

ALADDIN
Fine! You just stay in there--until _I_ order you out!

Aladdin tosses the lamp down, throws a pillow on top of it. He sees Abu and the Carpet, watching him reproachfully.

ALADDIN
What are you guys looking at?

The two turn away from the window, walk away.

JASMINE (0.S)
Ali...oh, Ali? Will you come here?

ALADDIN
Jasmine? Where are you?

IN THE RAFTERS: Iago throws his voice, imitating Jasmine.

IAGO (as Jasmine)
Out in the menagerie! Hurry!

Aladdin hurries out. Iago smiles. Glides down to the pillows. Takes the lamp.

IAGO
The right man for the job always a parrot...

EXT. GARDEN - DAY
Aladdin looks for Jasmine, puzzled. She comes up behind him.

JASMINE/ALADDIN
I've been looking all over for you.
(beat)
_You've_ been looking for _me_..?

JASMINE
Hurry...Papa's about to make the announcement...

She takes his hand, leads him into the palace.

INT. JAFAR'S LAB - DAY

CLOSE ON - the Lamp, in Jafar's hands. He stares at it reverently, ecstatic.

JAFAR
At last...The lamp. Genie...The _power_...is _mine_.

Iago, mighty pleased with himself, blows on his claws, polishes them on his chest.

IAGO
The heist was _flawlessly_ executed,

if I do say so... Jafar rubs the lamp--and the Genie appears.

GENIE
If you're gonna apologize, I don't ' know if I wanna hear it--

He is shocked to see Jafar holding the lamp.

GENIE
Uh-oh...You seen a little guy around here? About yea tall, big hat, ungrateful..?

JAFAR
I am your master now!

The Genie recoils, appalled.

GENIE
I was afraid of that...

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

Jasmine's birthday celebration in progress. Gates open, throngs of people cheering, waving banners, etc. The Sultan waves for silence. Jasmine, Raja at her side, stands behind him.

SULTAN
People of Agrabah! Thank you for joining us on this, my daughter's sixteenth birthday!
(crowd cheers)
But there's more to celebrate! Princess Jasmine has chosen a suitor!

The crowd CHEERS. One cry of 'It's about time!'

SULTAN
Now, I could scarcely believe it myself--

JASMINE
(mock hurt)
Papa!
(steps forward; to crowd)
Allow me to present Prince Ali Ababwa--the man I love!

Musicians strike up a reprise of 'Prince Ali' as Aladdin makes his entrance, atop Abu the elephant. The crowd CHEERS wildly. Aladdin smiles, waves. Abu looks back at him, disgusted, looks away. Aladdin notices, turns to the Carpet. The Carpet sits, back to him, arms crossed. Aladdin looks uneasy.

They reach the Suitan. Aladdin dismounts. The Sultan grabs his hand, shakes it zealously, ushers Aladdin to Jasmine. Jasmine looks beautiful, smiling radiantly at Aladdin.

INT. JAFAR'S LAB - DAY

JAFAR
Now, listen, Genie. This is my first wish: I wish...

Jafar draws a deep breath, savouring it; the moment is finally here. Iago looks on expectantly.

JAFAR
I wish to be Sultan!

IAGO
Yahoo! No more kissing up! No more taking orders!
(realizing)
No more _crackers_!

The Genie whips out his 'Royal Recipes' cookbook.

GENIE
Lessee here...Sultan, sultan--

Jafar slaps the book out of the Genie's hands.

JAFAR
My orders will be obeyed, slave! Make me the Sultan! The Genie stares at him, wary of this new master. He bows.

GENIE
(very proper)
As you command...master.

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

Aladdin and Jasmine move into an embrace. They're gonna kiss-- Suddenly, a magical effect swirls around the Sultan--

JASMINE
Papa!

--and then dissipates, revealing: Jafar now stands in the Sultan's spot, wearing Sultan robes. The Sultan has been shunted to one side, his robe and turban gone. Jasmine and the crowd gasp.

ALADDIN
Jafar!

JAFAR
_Sultan_ Jafar, Prince Abooboo.

IAGO
Or should we say...Aladdin? The Sultan goggles at Iago.

JAFAR
(to the crowd)
Bow before your Sultan!

Amazingly, the crowd bows.

SULTAN
What manner of trickery is this, Jafar?

JAFAR
No trickery, you rotund nincompoop--it is _power_!

A shadow falls across the courtyard. The crowd gasps-The Genie, huge, looms over the palace. Abu and the Carpet clutch each other in terror.

ALADDIN
Genie--what are you doing?

GENIE
(indicates Jafar)
My master's bidding...

Aladdin realizes what has happened. He is aghast.

JAFAR
I believe a sultan should wield his power from a palace high above the rabble he rules! Don't you agree, Genie?

The Genie nods sadly. He reaches down--
--And _lifts up the palace_ (including a chunk of courtyard). PANDEMONIUM as the crowd runs for cover from falling debris, leap from the courtyard to avoid be carried off, generally become hysterical.

The Genie carries the palace up to the mountains above Agrabah, sets it down on a precipice overlooking the city.

Aladdin grabs Jasmine's hand, pulls the Sultan to his feet, runs down the stairs.

ALADDIN
C'mon--we gotta get out of here--

JAFAR
Genie! Stop them!

The Genie's hand comes down, cutting them off. They turn--the Genie blocks that way, too. They are enclosed. The Genie opens his hands. Jafar stands there.

JAFAR
There is no escape! Now--bow to me!

The three glower at him--but make no move to bow.

JAFAR
Bow to me!

JASMINE
We will _never_ bow to you!

Jafar draws back, angry at being vexed.

JAFAR
If you will not bow, then you will- _cower_! Genie!--I want to ensure my will is done! I wish--

He pauses, considering--and then it comes to him.

JAFAR
I wish to be a sorcerer...the most powerful sorcerer in the world!

GENIE
As you command, master.

He gestures-- Jafar's snake staff, restored, magically appears in Jafar's hand. It is bigger than before, more menacing, crackling with power.

IAGO
Looks pretty sharp, Jafar..

JAFAR
(in awe)
I can feel the power...

He brandishes the staff at Jasmine. Steps toward her.

JAFAR
Now, princess--

From off-stage comes a SNARL-- Jafar spins as Raja LEAPS at him, fangs bared, claws extended-- Green energy lashes from the staff, strikes Raja--in mid-leap, Raja is transformed into a kitten, his roar becoming a 'meow.'

Iago swoops down, grabs him by the nape of the neck--

IAGO
Into the drink, you flea-bitten rat-chaser!

--and drops Raja into the fountain. Abu gasps--then uses his trunk to drain the fountain (saving Raja) and then sprays it back, hosing Iago.

Jafar, pleased with his staff, focuses his attention on Jasmine.

JAFAR
You say you love this boy, Princess...but do you _know_ him? Let me show you his true self!

He aims the staff at Aladdin--

Green energy lances out, enveloping Aladdin. The beam shoots on, striking Abu as well--he is transformed back into a monkey. The glow around Aladdin flashes--and then Aladdin stands there, in his rags, all princely refinement gone. He stares down at himself.

JASMINE
(shocked)
You _weren't_ in disguise in the marketplace...

ALADDIN
(reaching out to her)
Jasmine--I'm sorry--

JAFAR
The Sultan orders that this lying wretch be banished from Agrabah! Genie!

The Genie plucks Aladdin away from Jasmine, places him on a palace tower,

IAGO
(still dripping)
And the banana-suckin' monkey, too!

The Genie grabs Abu--the Carpet tries to pull him back, but can't hang on. Abu is placed in the tower,

JAFAR
Genie! Get rid of them! To the ends of the earth!

The Genie tears the tower from its foundation, lifts it. The Carpet, circling up behind the tower, darts into a window as the Genie cocks his arm.

ALADDIN
Genie! Don't!

GENIE
(sadly)
Sorry, Al--I haven't got a choice.

He hurls the tower away, like a spear, out over the horizon. The Genie sags, shakes his head:

The Sultan still kneels, head bowed, defeated.

Jasmine watches the tower go, terrified. Turns to look at-- Jafar, who jaughs malevolently as we

>FADE TO BLACK

EXT. ENDS OF THE EARTH - DAY

A BLIZZARD rages. Aladdin and Abu huddle near a section of the destroyed tower, shelter against the wind and snow.

ALADDIN
...I'm sorry, Abu. This is all my fault.
(lowers his eyes)
I should have freed the Genie when I had the chance
(miserable)
..like I promised.

He buries his face in his hands. Abu touches his shoulder comfortingly. Aladdin looks up. His features are set in determination.

ALADDIN
I have to go back. Even if I don't have the Genie...
(stands)
It doesn't matter if it takes the rest of my life...I have to try to set things right.

He steps out into the storm. Looks back at Abu.

ALADDIN
...on my own, if I have to.

Abu spots something. Points excitedly, chattering. The Carpet, stiff as a board, whips toward them, bucking and rolling in the heavy winds. It is heading inexorably toward the precipice. Aladdin leaps, grabs one of the Carpet's tassels. Is almost hauled out over the edge with it. Abu grabs his legs, anchors himself with his tail. Aladdin hauls the Carpet down. The Carpet is heavily iced.

ALADDIN
Carpet! You're okay.

The Carpet strains--the ice shatters.

ALADDIN
I have to get back to Agrabah. Can you fly through this?

The Carpet looks at the raging storm. Shakes his head sadly.

ALADDIN
What if you flew straight up-- _above_ the storm?

The Carpet considers...strikes a determined, heroic pose. Aladdin hops on. They look at Abu. Abu, with a cocky smile, shrugs, hops aboard.

ALADDIN
You guys are the greatest.

They both make the same 'shucks, we know' gesture--and then the Carpet kicks it into overdrive, flying STRAIGHT UP, through the blizzard, through the storm clouds.

It breaks through, above the storm, and heads for Agrabah.

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

The Sultan, dressed in jester's clothes, balances on a large ball as he juggles twelve smaller balls.

On the throne, Jafar lounges, enjoying the show. Iago is beside him. The lamp rests on a beautiful pedestal.

Raja, kitten-sized, stalks back and forth inside a bird cage.

JAFAR
Servant! Another drink!

IAGO
Y'know, I think the Sultan needs a new challenge...

Jasmine, scowling, in leg shackles, brings Jafar another drink.

JAFAR
Thank you, Jasmine--dear. You're right, Iago.

He gestures with his staff. Green fire from its eyes transform the Sultan's juggling balls into axes. The Sultan yelps, strains to keep them going.

JASMINE
Papa!
(to Jafar)
Stop it! Make it stop!

JAFAR
Perhaps in exchange for a foot massage...

She glowers, then kneels, pulls off his shoes. Rubs his feet. Jafar smiles, gestures with the staff. The Sultan bobbles the axes--just as they become water balloons. The Sultan gets drenched.

IAGO
Say, my feet are a little sore, too...

JAFAR
Of course. Genie! The Genie appears in a flash of light.

GENIE
Yes...master?

Jafar jerks a thumb in Iago's direction. Iago happily extends his claws, wiggles them. Bummed, the Genie massages them.

EXT. SKY - DAY

The Carpet emerges from the clouds. Aladdin spots-- The Palace, high on the mountainside above Agrabah.

ALADDIN
There it is! Abu! Open your eyes!

Abu peaks out from behind Aladdin's legs. The Carpet dives--

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

Jafar regards Jasmine, who continues to rub his feet.

JAFAR
It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine. A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world...not at his feet.

Jasmine looks up, startled. Jafar leans in at her, smiles.

JAFAR
What do you say, my dear? Why, with you as my queen--

JASMINE
(through clenched teeth)
_Never_.

She twists his toes. He cries out in pain.

JAFAR
AAGH! You wench! I'll teach you some respect!

He brandishes the staff toward her--then gets a better idea. Smiles wickedly.

JAFAR
(over his shoulder; still watching Jasmine)
Genie...I have decided to make my final wish.

GENIE
Uh-oh. ..what?

JAFAR
I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me!

Jasmine is appalled.

GENIE
Uh...master...There are a few addendas, some quid pro quos--

JAFAR
(whirls on him)
Don't talk back to _me_, you big blue lout!

ANGLE ON JASMINE, startled as she notices: ALADDIN, peering around a window into the throne room. Abu and the Carpet at his side.

JAFAR (0.S.)
You will do what I order you to _slave_!

GENIE
But--

JASMINE
(a velvet voice)
Jafar.

Jafar and the Genie look at her--missing Aladdin slipping in through the window.

JASMINE
I never realized how truly handsome you are...

Both the Genie and Jafar do jaw drops. Jafar tickles the Genie under the chin with the lamp.

JAFAR
That's better...

He leaves the befuddled Genie, moves toward Jasmine. That's when the Genie spots Aladdin, Abu and the Carpet, sneaking toward the lamp.

Aladdin puts a finger to his lips--the Genie nods, zips his mouth shut.

The Sultan hurries forward, also overjoyed to see Aladdin-- The Genie catches him, clamps a hand over his mouth.

Jasmine puts her arms around Jafar, turning him so his back is to Aladdin.

JASMINE
You've stolen my heart...

Iago spots Aladdin. He is barely able to get out a PEEP before the Carpet wraps him up tightly.

Jafar hears the PEEP and starts to turn--but Jasmine abruptly kisses him passionately.

Aladdin stops in his tracks, stunned. Abu keeps going, heading for the lamp.

Jasmine and Jafar relinquish their embrace.

JAFAR
That was...

Jafar reacts sharply. Reflected in Jasmine's eyes he sees Aladdin. He whirls.

Aladdin dives for the lamp--Jafar gestures with the staff--a green blast of pure force hits Aladdin, knocking him backwards into a wall. Aladdin is stunned.

JAFAR
You have more luck than brains, urchin--

Abu is at the lamp pedestal. He grabs the lamp, tosses it toward Aladdin-- --as it leaves his hand, Abu is transformed into a cymbal-clanking toy monkey.

JAFAR
Child's play...

Iago struggles free of the Carpet, plucks the lamp out of the air. The Carpet is close behind, tackles him--

IAGO
Jafar! HELP!

Jafar motions with the staff--a bevy of wicker carpet beaters appear, start whacking the Carpet. It lets go of Iago, tries to evade the beaters, but a new one appears in each direction it tries. They beat it hard, tearing it up.

The Sultan grabs up Jafar's cup, charges him.

SULTAN
Stop this at once, Jafar!

He hits Jafar, who gestures off-handedly. The Sultan becomes a marionette; he is lifted off his feet, hung from the ceiling.

JASMINE
Papa!
(to Jafar)
Let him go!

Jafar turns toward her.

JAFAR
_Concern_, my dear? Such a touching sentiment, for one whose heart is _stone_!

Jasmine backs away, turns, runs toward Aladdin-- Jafar gestures with the staff--Jasmine tries to scream, but no sound escapes--she has become a granite statue.

ALADDIN
Jasmine!

JAFAR
(points at Genie)
And you still owe me a wish!

Aladdin leaps at him.

ALADDIN
Dead men don't need wishes--

JAFAR
Is it hot in here, boy? Or is it just _you_?

Jafar gestures--a wall of flame appears. Aladdin runs from it. Swords drop from the ceiling, forcing Aladdin back toward the flames. He dives forward to avoid getting burned. One of the swords slashes his arm. He grabs it, uses it to ward off the falling blades.

GENIE
All right! Go, Aladdin!

JAFAR
You stay out of this!

The Genie is cowed--but then:

GENIE
(whispering)
Go, Aladdin!

Aladdin's doing pretty well, fending off falling swords, moving toward Jafar. The swords become anvils, and once again, Aladdin is dodging, avoiding near death.

ALADDIN
Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?

Jafar is incensed.

JAFAR
A snake, am I? Perhaps you'd like to see how snake-like I can be!

He grips his staff with both hands...and then flows into the staff, which grows, becoming a gigantic cobra, lamp in its coils. He looms over Aladdin.

ALADDIN
Uh-oh...

Jafar LUNGES. Aladdin uses the sword to fend him off, blade ringing off Jafar's fangs. Jafar lunges again, again, backing Aladdin across the room, outside, as he parries and dodges.

EXT. WIND-SWEPT PRECIPICE - DAY

Aladdin is backed to the very edge of the cliff. Jafar strikes
--Aladdin leaps back off the cliff's edge-- Jafar's fangs dig into the ground-- Aladdin uses a branch to swing back up, landing on Jafar's nose, hammering the fangs in further
--Aladdin sets to plunge his sword into Jafar's skull

Iago screeches down, rakes Aladdin with his claws--Aladdin loses his sword-- The Genie is genuinely angry.

GENIE
That's not fair!

Jafar yanks free and grabs Aladdin in his coils, squeezing---

JAFAR
You will be the first to taste the deadly wrath of the most powerful man in the world!

IAGO
You oughta feel honored!

Aladdin is in a very bad spot. He gets an idea, looks up at Jafar speculatively. Jafar squeezes--

ALADDIN
(in pain)
You're not so powerful--

JAFAR
(squeezing harder)
Is that so?

ALADDIN
I know--someone..._more_ powerful...

JAFAR
More powerful than me? Who?

Aladdin realizes he shouldn't say. He looks away, determined. Jafar wrenches him around, bearing down.

JAFAR
_WHO_? Tell me, boy--

ALADDIN
...never...

And then he casts a furtive glance at the Genie. Jafar notices it. Realization dawns.

JAFAR
The _Genie_...

IAGO
Jafar--he's right! The Genie gave you your power! He could take it away, too!

JAFAR
That will not happen! Genie! I make my third wish...A wish to secure my domination of the world. Genie-- I wish to be a Genie!

The Genie looks horror-stricken.

ALADDIN
No, Genie! Don't do it!

JAFAR
I order you, Genie! Now!

GENIE
(defeated)
Your wish...is my command.

He gestures... Magical energy swirls around Jafar. He transforms from snake to Genie, growing larger, blue-skinned. His brain is flooded with the secrets of the universe as his body is flooded with power.

JAFAR
Yes--YES! The power--the absolute _power_!...The universe is an open book before me! Mine to command! To control! To reshape to my design!

He glowers down from on high, huge and mighty. He raises his arms to gesture magically--

JAFAR
And I will begin by wiping the two of you from existence--what?!

Large gold cuffs appear, clamping onto his wrists--much like the Genie's.

JAFAR
What is happening?!

ALADDIN
You wanted to be a Genie? You got it!

GENIE
--and everything that goes with it!

Forming from the smoke trail at Jafar's feet, a lamp takes shape. Darker in color, more ominous-looking than the Genie's lamp. Jafar looks down: realization of his fate shows on his face--

JAFAR
No! NOOO!

Jafar is sucked down, screaming, into the lamp--

INT. THRONE ROOM

Abu is transformed back. The carpet-beaters vanish, the Carpet restored. The Sultan is freed, re-costumed in Sultan clothes Raja turns back into a tiger, breaking free of the cage. Jasmine reverts to flesh.

EXT. WIND-SWEPT PRECIPICE

Iago swoops down to the Jafar-lamp, lands on it.

IAGO
Jafar!

Suddenly, with a WHOOSH! the lamp shoots off toward the desert Iago hanging onto it, a trail of feathers left in its wake. Aladdin breaths a sigh of relief.

GENIE
Tell me you planned that.

ALADDIN
(a smile)
What do you think?

The Genie laughs, claps Aladdin on the back.

GENIE
Al, you little genius, you!

ALADDIN
Where did Jafar go?

GENIE
To the Cave of Wonders, of course...ten thousand years of imprisonment ought to mellow him out a little.

Aladdin spies Jafar's staff on the floor; it dissolves back into the old staff, finally breaking itself in two. Aladdin picks up the shards...flings them out over the balcony railing; they tumble down the mountainside.

EXT. AGRABAH - DAY

The Genie carries the Palace back to its rightfal place. Aladdin rides on his shoulder.

GENIE
Am I sorry I ever gave you a hard time! I like you a lot better than that beady-eyed meglomaniac!
(sets the palace down)
There--perfect!

EXT. PALACE - DAY
The Genie sets Aladdin down, shrinks, lands.

ALADDIN
I'm just glad you're all right--

GENIE
Right as rain! You won't hear another gripe out of me!

JASMINE
(hurrying to them)
Aladdin!
(embraces Aladdin)
You were wonderful!

ALADDIN
Jasmine...I'm sorry I lied to you...about being a prince.

GENIE
(butting in)
Listen--he only did it 'cause the little heartbreaker has such a crush on you...

JASMINE
(she likes it)
I know...
(saddens)
...and I can only marry a prince.

GENIE
(to Aladdin)
(cracks his knuckles)
No problem--just say the word, and I'll change you back...

ALADDIN
But, Genie--it's my last wish! What about... your freedom?

GENIE
(trying to laugh it off)
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude...
(presenting Jasmine)
_This_ is _love_!

JASMINE
Aladdin? What does he mean?

GENIE
(letting Aladdin in on important info)
Al--You're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years-- believe me, I know, I've looked!

Aladdin looks from Jasmine, to the Genie, to Jasmine. He is torn.

ALADDIN
Jasmine...I do love you.

Jasmine smiles. The Genie does, too--bittersweet; he believes Aladdin has chosen the girl and will wish to be a prince.

ALADDIN
Genie, I wish for...your freedom.

GENIE
One bona fide prince pedigree, coming up--what?

ALADDIN
My third wish is for you to be free.

GENIE
You...mean it? You wouldn't kid a kidder, would you?

ALADDIN
Genie...you're free!

The Genie is stunned. He raises his arms, looks at his wrists. The cuffs VANISH. He is amazed.

GENIE
(getting used to it)
I'm free...I'm _free_. I'm freeee! YAHOO!
(executes aerobatics)
Look ma, no lamp!
(smooches Jasmine)
Sorry--just takin' liberties! I am FREE!

JASMINE
What are you going to do?

GENIE
Are you kidding? There's a big wide world out there, and it's just waiting for a big wide guy like me!

He grabs up Aladdin in a bearhug.

GENIE
You are a _great_ kid. Now matter what anyone says, you'll always be prince to me.

ALADDIN
Good-bye, Genie...I'll miss you.

The Genie mists up a bit. He opens his mouth to say something-- but he is actually _too choked up to speak_. He nods, releases Aladdin...waves, as he lifts into the sky.

Aladdin turns to Jasmine. She looks at him admiringly.

ALADDIN
(takes Jasmine's hands)
I'm sorry...but I just can't pretend I'm something I'm not anymore...

Jasmine hugs Aladdin. Tears in her eyes.

JASMINE
I understand...It's just all so unfair...I _love_ you--

The Sultan hurries up, trailing the scroll behind him. Abu and the Carpet follow.

SULTAN
Jasmine! Aladdin! That Jafar was such a villainous liar...Listen! This is what the law really says: 'If, in the event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess may then be wed to _whomever she seems worthy_!

Aladdin and Jasmine are dumbfounded.

SULTAN
I guess that means you can choose...
(teasing)
...if you can find someone worthy...

A beat--Abu slicks back his hair real quick--

--and Jasmine smiles a huge smile, LEAPS into Aladdin's arms--

JASMINE
(pointing at Aladdin)
Him! Him! Him! I choose.
(to Aladdin)
I choose you.

Aladdin is ecstatic. He twirls away with her, celebrating. The Sultan smiles, satisfied, looks down at the scroll.

SULTAN
I thought you might say that...

He scowls, noticing something on the scroll. Cautiously touches it with his finger. Like wet ink, magical Genie sparkles stick to his finger. The Genie, small-sized, forms out of the sparkles, holding a quill pen.

GENIE
I figured it'd make a nice wedding present...

The Sultan is startled. He looks over at-- Aladdin and Jasmine, who are staring into each other's eyes.

The Sultan smiles.

SULTAN
A wonderful wedding present.
(confidentially)
It was a stupid law anyway...

They both laugh heartily. The Genie fades away, leaving the Sultan chuckling to himself.

EXT. PALACE COURTYARD - EVENING

Jasmine end Aladdin's wedding. They are on the balcony overlooking the thronged courtyard. The 'Arabian Nights' vamp begins.

Aladdin and Jasmine turn to each other. They kiss. A good one.

NARRATOR (0.S.)
~SO IT GOES, SHORT AND SHEET
~THEY WERE WED DOWN THE STREET...

Abu hugs, Raja. Raja licks Abu. Abu turns back to watch the ceremony. Raja smacks his lips ('hmn--tasty'), continues to eye Abu.

The Sultan looks very pleased with himself.

NARRATOR (0.S.)
~THINGS ALL WORKED OUT FOR THE BEST

The kiss ends. Aladdin and Jasmine wave, step aboard the Carpet. hey soar off together, into the deep blue sky. Fireworks bloom around them, cascade down--

NARRATOR (0.S.)
~HAPPY END TO THE TALE
~AND TOMORROW'S A SALE

The points of light FREEZE. The sky darkens, and the lights become stars in the night sky. PAN DOWN to--

EXT, AGRABAH - BAZAAR - NIGHT

--The Narrator as he sings the song.

NARRATOR
~SO I'D BETTER GO HOME AND REST
~HERE'S A KISS AND A HUG
~SURE YOU DON'T NEED A JUG?
~I ASSURE YOU THE PRICE IS RIGHT
~...WELL SALAAM, WORTHY FRIEND
~COME BACK SOO! THAT'S THE END
~'TIL ANOTHER.
~ARABIAN NIGHT!

The Narrator comes close into the camera. Suddenly he turns into the Genie. The Genie laughs heartily and ZING, he disappears in a sparkling FLASH which becomes more shimmering stars in the night sky.

>THE END.

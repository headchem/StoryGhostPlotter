INT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT

FROM THE BLACK WE HEAR—

MARK (V.O.)
Did you know there are more people with genius IQ's living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States?

ERICA (V.O.)
That can't be true.

MARK (V.O.)
It is true.

ERICA (V.O.)
What would account for that?

MARK (V.O.)
Well first of all, a lot of people live in China. But here's my question:

>FADE IN:

= 

INT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT

MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of any physically intimidating attributes masks a very complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye contact and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking to you or to himself.

ERICA, also 19, is Mark's date. She has a girl-next-door face that, makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be there and her politeness is about to be tested.

The scene is stark and simple.

MARK
How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT's?

ERICA
I didn't know they take SAT's in China.

MARK
I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about here.

ERICA
You got 1600?

MARK
You can sing in an a Capella group.

ERICA
Does that mean that you actually got nothing wrong?

MARK
Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar PC.

ERICA
Or you get into a final club.

MARK
Or you get into a final club, exactly.

ERICA
I like guys who row crew.

MARK
(beat)
Well I can't do that. And yes, it means I got nothing wrong on the test.

ERICA
Have you ever tried?

MARK
I'm trying now.

ERICA
To row crew?

MARK
To get into a final club. To row crew? No, Are you, like—whatever—crazy?

ERICA
Sometimes, Mark seriously you say two things at once and I'm not sure which one we're talking about.

MARK
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

ERICA
No.

MARK
Okay, well they're bigger than me. They're world class athletes. And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you'd met one.

ERICA
I guess I meant I liked the idea of it. The way a girl likes cowboys.

MARK
The Phoenix is good.

ERICA
This is a new topic?

MARK
It's the same topic.

ERICA
We're still talking about the finals clubs?

MARK
Would you rather talk about something else?

ERICA
No, it's just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs I think I may have had a birthday.

MARK
We can change the subject.

ERICA
(can't get over it)
There are more people in China with genius IQ's than the entire population of--

MARK
It's about exclusivity.

ERICA
God...what is?

MARK
The final clubs. And that's how you distinguish yourself. The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Pore.

ERICA
Which one?

MARK
The Porcellian, the Pore, it's the best of the best.

ERICA
I actually meant which Roosevelt.

MARK
Theodore.

ERICA
Okay, well, which is the easiest one to get into?

MARK takes a cigarette from a pack, lights it, takes a drag and blows the smoke out before he says...

MARK
Hm.

ERICA
What?

MARK
Why would you ask me that?

ERICA
I was just asking.

MARK
They're all hard to get into. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oil futures last summer and he won't get in. Money or the ability to make it doesn't impress anybody around here. Everybody can do that.

ERICA
He made $300,000 in a summer?

MARK
He likes meteorology.

ERICA
You said it was oil futures.

MARK
If you can predict the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. You, asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance.

ERICA
(beat)
I've lost my place again.

MARK
You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that's where I have the best chance.

ERICA
The one that's easiest to get into would be the one where anybody had the best chance.

MARK
I just, think you asked—the placement of where you asked the question--

ERICA
I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was asking just to ask. Mark, I'm not speaking in code.

MARK
Erica—

ERICA
You're obsessed with the finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about this who'll prescribe some sort of medication. You don't care if side effects may include blindness, okay, just, do it.

MARK
Final clubs. Not finals clubs and there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.

ERICA
Yes there is.

MARK
Well you do--that was cryptic--so you do speak in code.

ERICA
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

MARK
I'm saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs.

ERICA
Why?

MARK
because they're exclusive.
(beat)
And fun and they lead to a better" life.

ERICA
You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club?

MARK
He was a member of the Porcellian and yes I do.

ERICA
Maybe he sang in an a CapeIla group.

MARK
I want to be straight forward and tell you that I think you should be a lot more supportive. If I get in I'11 be taking you to the parties and you'll be meeting people that you wouldn't normally get to meet.

ERICA
smiles

You would do that for me?

MARK
You're my girlfriend.

ERICA
Okay, well I want to be straight forward and tell you that I'm not anymore.

MARK
(beat)
What do you mean?

ERICA
I'm not your girlfriend anymore,

MARK
Is this a joke?

ERICA
No, I'm sorry, it's not,

MARK
You're breaking up with me?

ERICA
You're going to introduce me to people I wouldn't normally get to meet? What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

MARK
Take it easy.

ERICA
What was it supposed to mean?

MARK
It was Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink is that you used to sleep with the door guy.

ERICA
(pause)
I want to really try not to lose it now. The door guy's name is Bobby. I haven't slept with the door guy, the door guy's a friend of mine. He's a perfectly good class of people and what part of Long Island are you from—England?

MARK
I'm from Westchester.

ERICA
I'm going back to my dorm. Wait, wait, this is real?

ERICA
Yes.

MARK
I apologize, okay? Siddown.

ERICA
I 'm going back to my dorm, I have to study.

MARK
Erica--

ERICA
Yeah.

MARK
I'm sorry and I mean it...

ERICA
I appreciate that but--

MARK
Come on.

ERICA
--I have to study.

MARK
You don't have to study. Let's just talk.

ERICA
I can't.

MARK
Why?

ERICA
Because it's exhausting. Going out with you is like dating a stairmaster.

MARK
All I meant is that you go to B.U. and so you're not likely to--I wasn't making a comment on your parents--I was saying you go to B.U.

ERICA
I have to go study.

MARK
You don't have to study.

ERICA
How do you know I don't have to study?!

MARK
Because you go to B.U.!

ERICA stares at him...

MARK
(beat)
Do you want to get some food?

ERICA
I'm sorry you're not sufficiently impressed with my education.

MARK
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat.

ERICA
I think we should just be friends.

MARK
I don't need friends.

ERICA
I was being polite, I had no intention of being friends with you.

MARK
You're really leaving.

ERICA takes MARK'S hand and looks at him tenderly...

ERICA
(close)
Listen, You're going to be successful and rich. But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a tech geek. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole.

And with that stinger, ERICA walks off and we stay on MARK as the pulsing intro to Paul Young's "Love of the Common People" crashes in--

ERICA
(calling over her shoulder)
And you're never getting into a final club.

Along with the MUSIC, we slowly push in on MARK. A fuse has just been lit.

Then a moment or two later, a glass with ice gets set down next to the lap-top. Then a carton of orange juice followed by a bottle of vodka,

MARK'S fingers dance easily on the keyboard--like a Juilliard pianist warming up.

In the exact time it takes him to pour the vodka and orange juice over ice, the website he's just called up gets loaded onto the screen,

Zuckonit.com

This is the only place he's comfortable.

He begins blogging.

MARK (V.O.)
Erica Albright's a bitch. You think that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht, or do you think it's because all B.U, girls are bitches?

He takes a good gulp of his drink. We see the words we're hearing filling up his computer screen--

MARK (V.O.)
Folks, for the record, she may look like a 34D but she's getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria's Secret, She's a 34B, as in barely anything there. False advertising.

In back of MARK, sitting on the bed and hitting a bong, is BILLY OLSEN.

MARK (V.O.)
The truth is she has a nice face. I need to think of something to help me take my mind off her. Easy enough, except I need an idea.

MARK has moved his mouse to an icon on his desktop labeled "Kirkland Facebook". He clicks and opens it. A menu of photos appear. He blogs again.

MARK
V.O.

I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie. So what if it's not even 10PM and it's a Tuesday night? The Kirkland facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook-pics. Billy Olson's sitting here and had the idea of putting some of these girls' faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who's hotter.

CUT TO:

INT. FINAL CLUB - NIGHT

We'll be cutting back here a lot in this sequence, with the Paul Young song tying them together, as we show--mostly MOS-- preparations under way for the hottest party on campus tonight.

We start on a good looking STUDENT fixing his tie in the bathroom mirror. He walks out of the bathroom and into the main area where he's immediately tossed a bottle of champagne by a similarly dressed STUDENT. We see that there are a couple of dozen other guys around. Our guy takes the champagne bottle and sticks it on the bar, which is being stocked by two sexy FEMALE uniformed BARTENDERS.

Our guy walks past a DJ's table where the DJ is setting up his incredibly high-end equipment.

Our guy trots down a set of mahogany and red-carpet stairs, opens a heavy door and looks out to the sidewalk.

A BOUNCER in a tuxedo is standing by a velvet rope which is holding back three dozen STUDENTS. The students are mostly women and the women are all dressed to catch a man.

Over all this, we HEAR MARK CONTINUING--

MARK (V.O.)
Good call, Mr. Olson! I think he's on to something.

TITLE:

10:17 PM

MARK (V.O.)
Yea, it's on, I'm not gonna do the farm animals but I like the idea of comparing two people together. It gives the whole thing a very Turing feel since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing a number to represent each person's hotness like they do on hotornot.com. The first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures. Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook so I'm going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in. Let the hacking begin.

INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

There are two more kids in the room with MARK--DUSTIN MOSKOWITZ and CHRIS HUGHES,

MARK (V.O.)
First up is Kirkland. They keep everything open and allow indexes in their Apache configuration, so a little WGET magic is all that's necessary to download the entire Kirkland facebook. Kids' stuff.

On the computer screen, we've been seeing him download picture after picture of Harvard girls.

Next is Elliot. They're also open but with no indexes on Apache. I can run an empty search and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page. Then I. can save the page and Mozilla will save all the images for me. Excellent. Moving right along.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - DAWN

The Harvard Crew is practicing on two-man sculls. There are three boats that are running roughly even with each other and the two-man crews are rowing with all they've got. We're gliding along with them in the water--

CREW MEMBER
shouting

Bring up the rate! 2 in 2! One...two--

ANOTHER CREW MEMBER (DIFFERENT BOAT)
Power 10 in 2! In 2!

A THIRD CREW MEMBER (DIFFERENT BOAT)

They had open water after a hundred meters. I don't think we're gonna catch 'em today.

And we PULL BACK TO REVEAL that there's a fourth boat which is already five boat lengths ahead of the other three.

The fourth boat is being crewed by CAMERON and TYLER WINKLEVOSS-—identical twins who stepped out of an ad for Abercrombie and Fitch.

They know that the others aren't in their class and even, though they're highly competitive athletes, they don't like showing anyone up, least of all their teammates.

CAMERON
Is there anyway to make this a fair fight?

TYLER
We could jump out and swim.

CAMERON
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.

TYLER
I'm not willing to do that.

CAMERON
What are we at three-quarter power? Let's drop down to a half.

TYLER
Or you could row forward and I could row backward.

CAMERON
I'd kick your ass.

TYLER
We're genetically identical, so biology and mathematics says we'd stay in one place not allowing for the current or the wind.

Just row the boat.

You guys hear about this?

INT. ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING ROOM - DAY

MARK stands before a panel of ADMINISTRATORS as well as COX, the systems manager who was woken up in the opening sequence.

ADMINISTRATOR
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an Administrative Board hearing. You're being accused of intentionally breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy by creating the website, WWW.FACEMASH,COM. You're also charged with being in violation of the university's policy on distribution of digitized linages. Before we begin with our questioning you're allowed to make a statement. Would you like to do so?

MARK
(beat)
Uh...I've, you know, I've apologized in the Crimson to the ABHW, to Fuerza Latina and to any women at Harvard who might have been insulted as I take it they were by the things that have been said to me in the last week. As for any charges stemming from the breach of security, I believe I deserve some sort of recognition from this Ad Board.

ADMINISTRATOR
(pause)
I'm sorry?

MARK
Yes.

ADMINISTRATOR
I don't understand,

MARK
Which part?

ADMINISTRATOR
You believe you deserve recognition?

MARK
I pointed out some pretty gaping holes in your system.

COX
Excuse me, may I?

ADMINISTRATOR
Yes.

COX
Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm in charge of security for all computers on the Harvard system. I can assure you of its sophistication and in fact it was that level of sophistication that led us to you in less four hours.

MARK
Four hours?

COX
Yes sir.

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

MARK is in his Operating Systems class. This is considered the hardest class at Harvard and MARK is one of the 50 students with their laptops open as the professor takes them through an impossibly difficult lesson.

PROFESSOR
So let's look at a sample problem: Suppose we're given a computer with a 16-bit virtual address and a page size of 256 bytes.

A GIRL scribbles something on a piece of paper. Then hands it to the student next to her and nods that it should be passed over to MARK. While that's happening--

PROFESSOR
The system uses one-level page tables, which start at address 0x0400. Maybe you want to have DMA on your 16-bit system, who knows? The first few pages are reserved for hardware flags, etc.

MARK opens the note. It reads "Asshole".

He looks over and sees a couple of GIRLS looking at him with contempt.

PROFESSOR
Assume page table entries have eight status bits.

MARK closes his laptop, gets up and starts to head out of the hall.

PROFESSOR
The eight status bits would be—

re: MARK

And I see we have our first surrender. Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg, brighter men than you have tried and failed at this class.

MARK
No.

Hi.

MARK is stealing a glance around the room...

CAMERON
Mark? This is Divya Narendra, our partner.

MARK
Hi.

DIVYA
We were really impressed with Facemash and then we checked you out and you also built CourseMatch.

MARK is looking at the framed black and white group pictures on the wall, of old Porcellian classes. He sees a pretty co-ed on the couch with her legs stretched over her boyfriend while they study.

DIVYA
Mark?

MARK
Yeah.

CAMERON
CourseMatch. You go online, you get to see what courses your friends are taking?

MARK
Yeah.

DIVYA
And you invented something in high school.

MARK
An app for an MP3 player that recognizes your taste in music.

DIVYA
Anybody try to buy it?

MARK
Microsoft.

DIVYA
How much did they pay?

MARK
I didn't sell it. I uploaded it for free.

DIVYA
For free?

MARK
Yeah.

DIVYA
Why?

MARK gives a short shrug that says both "I don't know" and "Fuck you" at the same time.

CAMERON
Well we've been working for a while on an idea. It's called Harvardconnection. You create your own page. Picture, bio, interests, friends.

TYLER
People can see your bio and request to be your--

MARK
Yeah. How's this different from MySpace or Friendster?

TYLER
How?

MARK
Yeah.

TYLER

CAMERON
Harvard.edu. The most prestigious e-mail address in the country.

TYLER
This site would be based on the idea that girls want to meet guys who go to Harvard. The difference between what we're talking about and MySpace, Friendster--

INT. LARGE LECTURE HALL - NIGHT

The lecture hall has been converted into "Alpha Epsilon Pi Caribbean Night, 2003" and the party is about as lame as it sounds. What's important is that this couldn't be less like the final club party we saw at the beginning if they were playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey.

Some potted palm trees have brought in along with a steel drum set. The man playing the steel drum set has a yarmulke bobby pinned to his thinning hair. A table with a punch bowl and assorted cookies is nearby.

EDUARDO, in baggy cargo shorts and a Hawaiian shirt buttoned up to the top, is standing with a few similarly dressed friends, including DUSTIN MOSKOWITZ and CHRIS HUGHES, in the sparsely populated room. On the other side of the room are a few girls--all Asian. One of the girls is wearing a bikini over her clothes. A television monitor has been set up with a DVD running of Niagara Falls.

EDUARDO
It's not that guys like me are generally attracted to Asian girls. It's that Asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me.

DUSTIN
I'm developing an algorithm to define the connection between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

EDUARDO
I don't think it's that complicated. They're hot, they're smart, they're not Jewish and they can't dance.

CHRIS
Mark's here.

They see MARK come in and look around. EDUARDO waves him over...

EDUARDO
Yeah.

MARK
It wasn't because I put up pictures of hot girls. You can go anywhere on the internet and see pictures of hot girls.

EDUARDO
Yeah.

MARK
It was because I put up pictures of girls that people knew. So if people want to go on the internet and check out their friends, why can't I build a website that offers that? An online community of friends. Pictures, profiles, whatever you can click into, visit, browse around. All from the privacy of your dorm room. I'm not talking about a dating site. I'm talking about taking the entire social structure of college and putting it online.

Or put a different way, not invite their friends to join. In a world where social structure is very important, that was sexy.

EDUARDO
Yes sir.

GAGE
At any time in the three weeks prior to Mark telling you his idea, did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss, Divya Narendra or Harvardconnection?

EDUARDO
Yes. He said they'd asked him to work on their site but that he'd looked at what they had and decided it wasn't worth his time. Uhh, he said even his most pathetic friends knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys.

GAGE
"These guys" meaning my clients.

EDUARDO
Yes. He resented—Mark resented that they--that your clients, probably thought he would 'jump at the chance to rehabilitate his image after the Facemash thing but Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything. With Facemash he'd beaten the Harvard computers, he'd beaten the Ad Board and he made the girls mad. Facemash did what he wanted it to do.

MARK kind of nods a little to himself. It should be noted that these depositions have an extra element of discomfort as everything is being said within a few feet of the people- being talked about.

GAGE
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building TheFacebook he was also communicating with the plaintiffs?

EDUARDO
Not at the time I wasn't. I am now.

GAGE
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building TheFacebook, he was leading the plaintiffs to believe he was building Harvard Connection?

Yeah.

Yeah.

INT. CAMPUS PUB - NIGHT

THE CROCODILLOS, Harvard's oldest male a Capella group, are singing at the front of the pub in their usual uniform of white tie and tails.

Incongruously, but with surprisingly nice results, the group is covering a song from The Backstreet Boys--"I Want it That Way"--and the pub full of students is loving it.

We find a table in the back where DIVYA is sitting with some of his friends who are having a nice time. DIVYA's got his laptop open.

MALE FRIEND
When did the Crocodillos start covering the Backstreet Boys? What happened to Cole Porter and Irving Berlin?

FEMALE FRIEND
It's a Valentine's theme. They're singing love songs.

MALE FRIEND
Good point, 'cause Cole Dorter and Irving Berlin never wrote any love songs,

FEMALE FRIEND
Divya, what are you reading?

DIVYA
Seven different people spammed me the same link.

We see DIVYA click his mouse on the link--

What is it?

I don't know, but I'm really hoping it's video of kittens that look like the Marx Brothers 'cause I can never get enough file footage on my computer of animals doing...

Shit.

He starts out again, then comes back for his coat, grabs it, starts out and falls down all over again.

Finally he's got it together and flies out of the pub and we

DIVYA's on his cell looking for MARK and TYLER, still in his practice clothes, has his desktop computer open to theFacebook and is studying it.

I called earlier. I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.

CAMERON

Yes sir, he's quoted a couple of times. I can read—it says, "'Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal facebook within' Harvard', he says"--he meaning Mark--"I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of, years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can and I did in a week."

Could you leave word that Divya Narendra called, I appreciate it.

CAMERON

I know, that's how he talks.

DIVYA

"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said over 650 students had registered to use theFacebook.com. He said he anticipated that 900 students would have joined the site by this morning."

CAMERON

Yeah, Divya was just reading that he'd signed up 650 people on the first day.

TYLER
If I were a drug dealer I couldn't give free drugs to 650 people in one day.

Guys, please, for just one second.

That's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss. We're gonna put it all together right now and e-mail it to you.

You won't be able to get on the site yourself.

CAMERON
Because you went to Ohio State. But we'll take care of everything and we'll talk to you first thing in the morning. This is a good guy--

This is a good guy?

CAMERON
We don't know that he's not a good guy.

DIVYA
We know that he took our idea and stole it. We know that he lied to. our faces for a month and a half-while he--

CAMERON
He didn't lie to our faces.

DIVYA
He never, saw our faces! Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts and he got himself a 42-day head start because he knows what apparently you don't which is that getting there first is everything!

CAMERON
I'm a competitive racer, Div, I don't think you need to school me on the importance of getting there first.

DIVYA

Alright. That was your father's lawyer on the phone with you?

CAMERON
Yeah, well his in-house counsel. We're gonna send him everything and he'll look at it and if he thinks it's appropriate he'll send a cease and desist letter.

DIVYA
A cease and desist letter doesn't have any teeth.

CAMERON
Zou think we should hire lawyers and sue him?

DIVYA
I think we should hire lawyers and have them beat him senseless with a crescent wrench.

TYLER
We don't have to do that.

CAMERON
That's right.

TYLER
We can do it ourselves.

CAMERON
Hey--

TYLER
I'm six-five, 220-pounds and there are two of me.

CAMERON
And I'm saying let's calm down until we know what we're talking about.

DIVYA
Just how much more information are you waiting for? We met with Mark three times, we exchanged 52 e-mails, we can prove that he looked at the code, he'd seen what Victor had already done and we talked at length about what we planned to do.

Yes.

MARK
From that you're deducing that I didn't go to them because I didn't want them to know what I was working on? I went to my best friend for the money because he's who I wanted to be partners with because of our similar vision and his superior business skills.

There's a lower-level and a balcony and both are full.

MARK and EDUARDO are sitting in the second to last row of the balcony.

We'll hear the SPEAKER but we'll only get to see him in a slightly blurry image as our attention is on MARK and EDUARDO.

SPEAKER
And it was a clear day. And I was up in my Radcliffe dorm. And he brought that up there and said, "Look, it's going to happen without us. We've got to do it now." And so I said..."Okay."

He gets an appreciative LAUGH from the STUDENTS,

SPEAKER
Now the starting of this industry was very humble indeed. The kit computer on the cover of that magazine--

We HEAR a little muffled giggling coming from the row behind MARK and EDUARDO, MARK is too into the speech to notice but the giggling registers as a slight annoyance on EDUARDO'S face.

SPEAKER
--had an 8080 processor in it, and you had to assemble it yourself and it came with 256K of memory.

EDUARDO hears the giggling again and turns around.

In the row behind them and a few seats over are two beautiful Asian students--ALICE and JENNY. They're a little overly made-up for a lecture, JENNY, the one sitting closest to EDUARDO, is wearing a short skirt with a white shirt open one button too far down the front and we can see a hint of the red bra she's wearing underneath.

She leans forward and whispers to EDUARDO--

JENNY
whispering

Your friend~-isn't that Mark Zuckerberg?

JENNY

Do they have grounds?

MARK
Yes, the grounds are theFacebook is cool and popular and sexy and Harvardconnection is lame. I didn't use any of their code, I didn't use anything. A guy who builds a really nice chair doesn't owe money to everyone who's ever built a chair. They came to me with an idea, I had a better one.

Okay.

MARK turns and goes and sees that EDUARDO has been standing at and watching from a distance with JENNY.

It was good, Mark.

MARK

We have to expand.

EDUARDO

MARK
We have to expand.

Once the door is closed--

MARK
We're expanding theFacebook to Yale and Columbia. Dustin, I want you to share, the coding work with me, Chris, you're going to be in charge of publicity and outreach. You can start by getting a story about the expansion in the B.U. student newspaper.

CHRIS
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

MARK
Somebody at the newspaper will be a computer science major and they will have heard of me. Tell 'em Mark Zuckerberg will do 10 hours of free programming for them.

EDUARDO
Why do you want a story in the B.U.--

MARK
Because I do. Here's the business arrangement. Eduardo's CEO and owns 30% of the company, Dustin's Vice President and Head of Programming and his 5% of the company will come from my end. Chris is Director of Publicity and his compensation will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing. Any questions?

DUSTIN
Who are the girls?

EDUARDO
Jenny and Alice.

DUSTIN
Hi.

JENNY
Hi.

ALICE
Hello.

CHRIS
Hi.

JENNY
Is there anything we can do?

MARK is sitting alone in the now empty room. There's a computer on a table in the corner and MARK makes a few keystrokes and then reads the screen.

MARYLIN, the young lawyer we met early on, comes in with a plastic salad container in her hand and sits at the far end of the table from MARK, who doesn't acknowledge her.

MARYLIN
after a moment

You don't want any lunch?

MARK
(beat)
No.

MARYLIN
You're welcome to some of my salad.

MARK
No thank you.

MARYLIN
I know this must be hard.

MARK
Who are you?

MARYLIN
I'm Marylin Delpy, I introduced myself this morning.

MARK
I mean what do you do?

MARYLIN
I'm a second year associate at the firm. My boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition phase.

MARK nods ...

MARYLIN
What are you doing?

MARK
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.

MARYLIN
Bosnia?

MARK nods...

MARYLIN
They don't have roads but they have Facebook?

MARK nods.,.

MARYLIN
You really hate the Winklevoss twins, don't you.

DIVYA
I want to hire a lawyer to file for injunctive relief and get this website taken down now!

CAMERON
Look--

DIVYA
Every minute it's up, Harvard Connection becomes less valuable, I want an injunction, I want damages, punitive relief and I want him dead.

CAMERON
I want those things tool

DIVYA
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?! Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?!

CAMERON
Because, you're not thinking about how it's going to look.

DIVYA
How's it going to look?

CAMERON
Like my brother and I are dressed in skeleton costumes chasing the Karate Kid around a high school gym.

DIVYA
He violated Massachusetts state law. Then when he goes to Connecticut, New York and California he'll have violated federal law. And by the way, he's violated Harvard law.

CAMERON
There's no such thing as Harvard Law.

TYLER
(pause—realizing)
Wait. Yes there is.

TYLER goes to the bookshelf and pulls down a manual.

TYLER
Harvard Student Handbook. Every freshman is issued this book. Somewhere in here it says—

CAMERON

DIVYA
You think campus security is going to arrest him for copyright violation?

CAMERON
We're going to meet with the president.

DIVYA
You can't get a meeting with Larry Summers.

CAMERON

INT. A GIRL'S COLLEGE APARTMENT (PALO ALTO) - MORNING

A pretty 20 year-old co-ed, AMY, pulls a curtain open and the darkened room immediately fills with un-welcomed sunlight.

AMY
You don't know my name, do you?

AMY's wearing nothing but a Stanford sweatshirt and talking to a skinny 22 year-old guy who's lying on her futon. There's other evidence on the walls that we're at Stanford University.

There are also pieces of AMY's clothing strewn about.

The young man on the futon is SEAN PARKER.

SEAN
Is that something that's important to you?

AMY
Yes.

SEAN
If I say your name will you stop the enhanced interrogation techniques?

AMY
Yes.

SEAN
Amy.

AMY
Nice, what's my major?

SEAN
(pause)
Trombone.

AMY
Really?

SEAN
I remember something about a trombone.

AMY
That was the beer bong. Tu fais l'amour a la jolie fille et la mets de cote.

SEAN

AMY
Oui. And what's yours?

SEAN
My major?

AMY
Yes.

SEAN
I don't have one.

AMY
You haven't declared?

SEAN
I don't go to school here.

You're kidding?

SEAN
No.

AMY
Where do you go to school?

SEAN
Grover Cleveland Elementary.

AMY
Seriously, you're not like 15 years old or anything are you?

SEAN
No, I'm 22.

You're not like 15 years—

AMY
No.

SEAN
Good.

AMY
So what do you do?

SEAN
I'm an entrepreneur.

AMY
You're unemployed.

SEAN
I wouldn't say that,

AMY
What would you say?

SEAN
That I'm an entrepreneur,

AMY
What was your latest preneur?

SEAN
Well...I founded an internet company that let college kids download and share music for free.

AMY
Kind of like Napster?

SEAN
No, exactly like Napster.

AMY
What do you mean?

SEAN
I founded Napster.

AMY
Sean Parker founded Napster.

SEAN
Nice to meet you.

AMY

You're Sean Parker?

SEAN
Ah, you see, the shoe's on the other, uh, table which has turned.

AMY
I just slept with Sean Parker?

SEAN
All night long, Sister Souljah.

AMY
You're a millionaire.

SEAN
Not technically.

AMY
What are you?

SEAN
Technically?

AMY
Yeah.

SEAN
Broke. There's not a lot of money in free music. Even less when you're being sued by everyone who's ever been invited to the Grammys.

AMY
I think you're cool.

SEAN
Me too.

AMY
I have to hop in the shower and get ready for class. There's juice or anything else you can find. Help yourself.

SEAN
You mind if I check my e-mail?

AMY
Go ahead.

AMY heads into the bathroom but leaves the door a little ajar.

SEAN steps over to AMY's pink laptop and hits a key to wake it out of sleep mode.

The shower starts running in the bathroom.

The laptop springs to life, and is open to something SEAN'S never seen before--a Facebook page.

He sees AMY's picture and a short profile; Her major at Stanford, courses she's taking, books she likes, clubs she's a member of...

SEAN
(calling)
Amy?

She can't hear him in the shower.

SEAN explores around a little more. He knows his way around a computer. He sees her "friends". Friend after friend after friend.

SEAN

Jesus.

He gets up and goes to the bathroom door—

SEAN
Amy?

AMY
(calling back)
Yeah!

SEAN
Can you come out here?

AMY
Just a second.

SEAN
There's a fire, Amy.

AMY
What?!

AMY grabs a towel and jumps out of the shower--

AMY
Where?!

SEAN
Okay, there isn't a fire, but I need to ask you something.

AMY
Are you kidding?!

SEAN
No.

AMY

SEAN
How?

AMY

What do you need to ask me?

SEAN
I went to check my e-mail and there's a website open on your computer.

AMY
Yeah. After you went unconscious last night I went on theFacebook for a while.

SEAN
What's that?

AMY
TheFacebook? It started at Harvard and Standford's had it for about two weeks and it's awesome except it's addictive. Seriously, I'm on the thing five times a day, all my friends are.

You mind if I grab a piece of paper and a pen?

AMY

SEAN
Absolutely nothing. It's beautiful.

CAMERON and TYLER, in dark suits, are waiting to see the president of Harvard.

The President's office is in one of the two oldest university buildings in the country, and the SECRETARY sitting at the desk is even older. You get the sense that she thinks Harvard would be a better place if it weren't for all these students.

She looks at them and the boys give her a polite smile and a small nod before she goes back to her work.

CAMERON
just making small talk

I've never been in this building.

SECRETARY
without really looking up

This building is a hundred years older than the country it's in.

CAMERON
that's interesting

Hm.

So do be careful.

INT. SUMMERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

LARRY SUMMERS, a large man, is on the phone at his desk in his well-appointed office. A fire crackles in the sitting area and a 40-ish African-American woman, ANNE, in a pants suit is nearby going over some papers.

SUMMERS waves the boys in--

SUMMERS
(into phone)
That's just their own stupidity, I should have been there.
(into phone)
Darkness is the absence of light and stupidity in that instance was the absence of me.

SUMMERS motions for them to sit and they do. They take in some of the photographs around the room—SUMMERS with BILL CLINTON, etc.

SUMMERS
(into phone)
Catherine, I have students in my office now.
(into phone)
Students.
(into phone)
Undergrads.
(into phone)
I don't know, from the looks of it I think they want to sell me sets of identical Brooks Brothers suits. We'll speak later.

SUMMERS hangs up the phone--

SUMMERS
Good morning.

CAMERON
Good morning, sir. I'm Cameron Winklevoss and this is my brother, Tyler.

CAMERON is extending his hand but instead of taking it, SUMMERS reaches to the top of a pile of papers and pulls a ten-page letter off the top.

SUMMERS
Why are you here?

There's silence while SUMMERS appears to read over the letter...

SUMMERS
That wasn't rhetorical.

CAMERON
I'm sorry, I thought you were reading the letter.

SUMMERS
I've read the letter.

CAMERON
Well I think it's pretty self-explanatory. We had an Idea for a website called Harvardconnection—we've since changed the name to ConnectU—and Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea and—

SUMMERS
What do you want me to do about it?

CAMERON points to a row of Harvard Student Handbooks on the bookshelf behind SUMMERS.

CAMERON
Well sir, in The Harvard Student Handbook, which is distributed to each freshman—under the heading "Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community" and the sub-heading, "Honesty"—

SUMMERS
Oh dear God.

CAMERON
--it says, "The College expects that all students will be honest and forthcoming in their dealings with members of this community. All students are required to respect private and public ownership. Instances of theft, misappropriation or unauthorized use of or damage to property or materials—

SUMMERS
Excuse me, Anne?

ANNE
Yes sir.

SUMMERS
Punch me in the face.
(beat--then to CAMERON)
Go ahead.

CAMERON
(beat)
--will result in disciplinary action, including the requirement to withdraw from the College. That's what is says in the handbook.

SUMMERS
When did you memorize that?

TYLER
(a little frustrated with this bullshit)
Sir, it's against University rules to steal from another student, plain and simple.

SUMMERS
You've spoken to your R.A.?

CAMERON
Yes sir, and the R.A. made a recommendation to the Ad Board but the Ad Board won't hear us.

SUMMERS
Have you tried dealing with Mr. Zuckerberg directly?

CAMERON
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't responded to any of our e-mails or phone calls for the last' two weeks. He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland and the closest we've come to talking face to face is when I saw him on the quad and chased him through Harvard Square.

SUMMERS
You chased him?

CAMERON
(beat)
I saw him and I know he saw me and I started after him and he disappeared.

SUMMERS
You know he could have you arrested for harassment and attempted assault.

TYLER
quietly

This isn't happening.

SUMMERS
I don't see this as a University issue.

TYLER
Of course it's a University issue. There's a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both.

SUMMERS
You entered into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other.

TYLER
(beat)
I'm sorry President Summers, what you just said makes no sense to me at all.

SUMMERS
I'm devastated by that.

CAMERON
What my brother means is that if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer it would be a university issue, right?

SUMMERS
I really don't know. This office doesn't handle petty larceny and the only reason I agreed to see you--Anne, why did I agree to see them?

ANNE
Colleagues of their father.

SUMMERS
So you see?

TYLER
This isn't a petty larceny.

CAMERON
calming

Ty--

TYLER
This idea is potentially worth millions of dollars.

SUMMERS
Millions of dollars?

CAMERON
Yes.

SUMMERS
You might be letting your imagination run away with you.

TYLER
With all due respect I don't think you're in any position to make that call,

SUMMERS
I was U.S. Treasury Secretary, I'm in some position to make that call.

TYLER
Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told to do in your freshmen address.

SUMMERS
Well. I would try letting your, imaginations run away with you on a new project.

TYLER
You would.

SUMMERS
Everyone at Harvard is inventing something or starting a new business in their dorm room. Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than getting one so can I suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project?

CAMERON
I'm sorry, but that's not the point, sir.

SUMMERS
What's the point?

CAMERON
You don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand, the difference between right and wrong.

SUMMERS
And you're saying that I don't?

CAMERON
Of course I'm not saying that.

TYLER
I'm saying that,

SUMMERS looks at TYLER and then smiles...

TYLER
Just start another project? Like we're making a diorama for the science fair?

SUMMERS
Yes. And if you have a goddam problem with that, Mr. Winklevoss, the courts are always at your disposal. Athletes don't get special treatment at this school.

TYLER
Do they get fairness?

SUMMERS
They don't get to run to daddy. Okay? This isn't 50 years ago.

TYLER
Excuse me, sir, but in your analogy, is daddy our father or you?

SUMMERS
Both. Is there anything else I can do for you?

TYLER
Well I wouldn't mind that much if you took a flying—

SEAN
See, we had a VC from the beginning. Michael Moritz, a partner at Sequoia Capital who'd invested in Yahoo and Google. Moritz wanted to push me out from the beginning and he hired private detectives to dig up everything on me they could. Did they find anything? No. But I was out of the company. I'm not done with Moritz and Sequoia Capital yet. I swear to God, Mark, before I'm 25 I'm gonna make those guys kiss my ass and then cry like girls.

Okay. For instance, we wanted Baylor in Texas but Baylor already had a social network on campus so instead of going right after them, we made a list of every school within a hundred miles and put theFacebook on those campuses first. Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were seeing their friends on our site and we were in.

The dining hall was serving chicken for dinner and I had to feed my chicken, so I just... I cut up little pieces of chicken and gave it to the chicken.' There were a lot of people there and someone must have seen me and the next thing I knew I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

At the end of the table, MARYLIN' tries but fails to stifle a small laugh.

EDUARDO looks down the table...

MARK
Alright, let's just forget about it.

EDUARDO
I can't forget about it, I'm being accused of animal cruelty. It's better to be accused, of armed robbery. I'm going to have to explain this to my father, I'm going to have to explain this to everyone, I'm going to have to—what is happening on that?

EDUARDO'S referring to a laptop that's open and displaying images of four paintings.

MARK
I have my final coming up for "Postwar and Contemporary Art" and I haven't been to class. I'm supposed to write about those four paintings.

EDUARDO
Is that a Facebook page?

Yeah, I opened it under an alias. I posted the paintings and asked people to comment. Every once in a while I hop on and stir the pot to get a good debate going, it's beautiful.

GRETCHEN
Well you just told us he was cheating.

EDUARDO

EDUARDO
What?

MARK
I already found a house for rent on a street two-blocks, from the Stanford campus. It's a piece of junk but it's perfect and it's got a pool.

EDUARDO
When did you decide to go to California for the summer?

You mean when did I actually decide?

INT, COMPUTER SCIENCE BUILDING/BASEMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

EDUARDO steps through double doors and stops for a moment as he HEARS an odd sound—RAUCOUS CHEERING from a CROWD that's gathered in one of the classrooms.

EDUARDO walks down to the classroom, opens the door and walks into--

INT, CLASSROOM - NIGHT

--where'60 or so STUDENTS are in a semi-circle, five and six deep, cheering on the contestants for the internship.

All the desks in the room have been moved to the sides and five desks with laptops set up in the middle. Next to each laptop is a shot glass filled with Jack Daniels.

DUSTIN'S holding a watch and MARK is walking slowly back and.

forth behind the five "interviewees" who are intensely typing at their keyboards.

EDUARDO slowly makes his way through the crowd to MARK. He can see that on the computer screens are a whole lot of numbers and letters that neither he nor we can understand.

He stands next to MARK and watches this for a moment. Every once in a while, one of the contestants will throw back their shot of Jack Daniels which will instantly get re-filled by a PRETTY ASIAN GIRL. Throughout all this the CHEERING CONTINUES.

EDUARDO
(pause)
Mark?

MARK
Yeah.

EDUARDO
What's goin' on?

MARK
They have 10 minutes to get root access to a Python webserver, expose its SSL encryption and then intercept all traffic over its secure port.

EDUARDO
They're hacking.

MARK
All behind a Pix Firewall Emulator. But here's the beauty.

EDUARDO
You know I didn't understand what you just said, right?

MARK
I do know that.

EDUARDO
What's the beauty?

MARK
Every 10th line of code written, they have to drink a shot. And hacking's supposed to be stealth, so anytime the server detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to drink a shot. I also have a program running that has a pop-up window appear simultaneously on all five computers—the last candidate to hit the window has to drink a shot. Plus every three minutes they all have to drink a shot.

DUSTIN
calling out

Three minutes.

All five candidates drain their shot glasses and slam them down where they get re-filled by the pretty Asian girl.

EDUARDO
Can I ask—what part of the Interns jobs will they need to be able to do drunk?

MARK
You're right. A more relevant test would be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

What I just said was mean and I'm sorry.

Are we alright? We started this as a team.

EDUARDO hands MARK a thick envelope--

EDUARDO

EDUARDO
I opened a new account and put ?18,000 in it. Will that get you through the summer?

MARK looks at EDUARDO...

Suddenly two of the candidates hands shoot up almost at the same time--

MARK glances over at the first screen, then the second...

After expressing misgivings about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company and moving it to California for the summer, why did you turn around and put $18,000 in an account for his use?

EDUARDO
Well...I figured we were a team and I wanted to be a team player. I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns could work on the site while I worked on generating advertiser interest in New York.

EDUARDO
And mostly I figured, you know...how much could go wrong in three months?

EXT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - DAY

MARK is standing on the roof of this small, campus-area house as LOUD MUSIC plays. A zip '.line is tied from the chimney and runs down over a small swimming pool where it's attached to a telephone pole on the other side.

MARK grabs onto the handle that's connected to the zip line and flies out over the pool, jumping in with a splash and cheers from DUSTIN and the INTERNS who are waiting their turns on the roof.

DUSTIN pulls the handle back up with a rope that's been rigged, grabs the handle, takes off and jumps into the pool to similar cheers.

The handle gets pulled back on a rope, an INTERN grabs it, jumps--

--and the brick chimney comes crashing down.

The INTERN drops into patio furniture as bricks from the chimney come cascading down.

Everyone scrambles--

ALL
Shit!/Are you alright?!/ Jesus!/eta.

INTERN (ERIC)
I'm okay.

MARK
You sure?

ERIC
Yeah.

MARK
Is anything broken?

ERIC
No.

And at that moment a stray brick drops from the roof and crashes through a glass patio table.

INTERN (STEVEN)
That's gonna cut into the security deposit.

From inside the DOORBELL RINGS—

DUSTIN
That's the doorbell.

MARK walks into--

INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The place is computer geek paradise., Computers are everywhere, along with some of the empty boxes they came in. Pizza boxes, Chinese food containers, empty beer bottles and white boards filled with indecipherable code fill the room. There are a couple of large mattresses on the floor and a large map of the U.S. with pins and tags showing the schools where they've already put Facebook and different pins showing the schools they're going for.

As MARK walks to the door, he walks past ANDREW, who's sitting at a computer, writing code and completely oblivious to everything around him.

MARK
snapping his fingers

Andrew.

ANDREW
Not now.

MARK
Good boy.

MARK gets to the door and opens it.

He's stunned to see SEAN PARKER standing there with his girlfriend, SHARON.

They all look at each other for a moment—

SEAN

MARK
Yeah. Do you?

MARK
No. You live across the street.

A beer comes flying out of the kitchen and SEAN catches it.

MARK (OS)

Another beer comes flying out which SHARON had no idea was coming and so it smashes into the fireplace.

SHARON
Oh God. I'm so sorry.

And a brick comes down the chimney and crashes on top of the broken glass from the beer bottle.

You know, ironically, we're paying an extra 50 bucks a month 'cause it has a working fireplace.

INT. RUBY SKYE - CONTINUOUS

It's a hundred-year old theater that's been converted into a 21st Century hot spot for Silicon Valley's rock stars. The lower level is a giant dance floor packed with sweating 20-somethings bouncing to pounding house music. There are raised blocks where scantily dressed professional dancers perform non­ stop. A huge lighting grid hangs from the ceiling shooting colored lights and lasers everywhere. Also hanging from the ceiling are two trapeze bars with two performers swinging and contorting.

A WAITRESS holding a tray of colored drinks high over her head takes us through the crowd to a spiral staircase that's being guarded by two more BOUNCERS with clipboards. The staircase leads up to the 2nd level which is all VIP tables that look out over the dance floor. Each VIP area has a couple of couches and a table covered in bottles of vodka, tequila, rum, mixers, ice, glasses and a private waitress who's happy to bend over and pour a drink for you,

And that's where we catch up with MARK and SEAN. Sitting next to SEAN is a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and there's another standing behind him and leaning against the couch.

MARK and SEAN have to the music.

MARK
I still can't believe I rented a house across the street from you.

SEAN
That's not my house. It was Sharon's. I was crashing there for a little, bit while I'm taking care of some things. But she's done for the summer so she's back at her parents' place and I'm homeless.

I was going out with this girl in high school. And it was great. I thought it was great, but the whole time—almost the whole time we were together, like five months--she was giving blow jobs to the co-captain of the lacrosse team. And I found out and I was willing to forgive her but she told me she loved him. So I had this dream that I would make a billion dollar company. Not a million dollar company—any hack can do that--a billion dollar company. And I would have business cards printed up that said, "I'm CEO...Bitch."

SEAN
The company's here. A billion dollar company is here. And what confuses me is that in New York, Eduardo introduced himself as the business head of Facebook. I've been at the front of two of the biggest things in the history of the internet and I can tell you that nothing, nothing is more important to a start-up than the energy and ambition of its founders.

SEAN
You have to live and breathe the project every minute of every day and-night. Do you live and breathe Facebook?

MARK
Yes.

SEAN
I know you do. I know those guys back at the house do. The guy's eyes did not blink when a beer bottle smashed into a fireplace 10 feet from his workstation. So I'll ask again-where's Eduaro?

EXT. THE THAMES - DAY

We're looking at a stone bridge crossing a. perfectly straight stretch of water against the backdrop of the medieval town of Henley, England--founded in 1179.

And after a moment of placid quiet -- BOOSH!

Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for the final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and prestigious Henley Royal Regatta.

The two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge. The port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the Hollandia Roeiclub. The starboard boat is being crewed by a pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the "H" of Harvard.

We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot— the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men in blazers and brightly colored floral ties.

But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural straight stretch of water in the world—a mile and a half torture test against the best competition they've ever faced.

And they're neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can't shake the Dutch.

The CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none of them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late.

Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of Americans.

We'll notice a stoic man in a VIP viewing section and .later we'll be introduced, to him as Cameron and Tyler's father. Next to him is their mother, who can barely watch.

Back on the boats it's just the breathing as the skulls slice through the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and there's still no daylight between them.

We see a small trickle of blood from CAMERON'S left hand begin to stream down his arm.

25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy-- even the British aristocracy can't help but get caught up in the closest race in the history of the competition. The FATHER is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed-- the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position.

The blood that's covering CAMERON'S left arm is being diluted by the sweat that's pouring down from his triceps as they dig, and pull, and pull, and pull, and--POP!
--the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over.

CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch group holding a giant flag and jumping up and down. The Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up.

The two DUTCH CREW. MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop.

The MOTHER drops her head and looks down. The FATHER refuses to look away.

From CAMERON and TYLER, just the breathing.

After a moment, a man in a double breasted navy blazer steps out with his retinue in tow. The man is PRINCE ALBERT of Monaco. He receives a healthy clapping of golf applause as he approaches the stand.

This conversation is done without microphones or anything as modern as that.

AIDE

My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one of the premiere rowers of his day. I've been coming to Henley for 30 years. Never seen a race that close. Have you? Have you seen a race that, close?

CAMERON is thinking about starting a war with Monaco right now so he lets his brother do the talking.

TYLER

No, Your Highness. Mile and a half races are more commonly won by a boat length or two.

EDUARDO
What the hell.

SEAN

I'll call you back,

to EDUARDO

What's up?

EDUARDO
(long pause)
What's up?
(beat)
Mark was supposed to get me at the airport two hours ago, I've been calling his cell.

SEAN
He was on a 36 hour coding tear so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

EDUARDO walks into the house and surveys the wreckage—

EDUARDO
What in hell happened here?

SEAN
Not happened—happening. The next big thing.

DUSTIN
Ward!

EDUARDO
Hey man.

SEAN

Back to work.

The girl at the bottom of the stairs has filled the bowl and lights a lighter--

GIRL #1
You ready?

GIRL #2
Go.

EDUARDO watches as the girl at the top of the stairs takes a 12-foot hit from the tower-bong.

EDUARDO
How old are they, Sean?

SEAN
It's not polite to ask.

EDUARDO
How old are they?

SEAN
You think you know me, don't you.

EDUARDO
I've read enough.

SEAN
You know how much I've read about you? Nothing.

MARK comes down the stairs--

MARK
Wardo.

EDUARDO
I waited an hour for you at the airport.

MARK
What time is it?

EDUARDO
It's midnight. Or 3AM in New York where I just came from.

MARK
You've gotta see some of the new stuff we've got. Dustin, show him the wall. I'm just calling it the wall. 132.

SEAN
Forget the wall, tell him about the meeting I've got set up with Peter Thiel.

to EDUARDO

You know Peter Thiel?

EDUARDO
No.

SEAN
Why would you? He just runs a two-billion dollar hedge fund called Clarium Capital and was the. money behind PayPal)

EDUARDO
(to MARK)
Why's he setting up meetings?

MARK
Thiel may want to make an angel investment.

EDUARDO
I don't care if he's an actual angel, why's he setting up business meetings?

MARK
You've had a long flight.

EDUARDO
No, I've had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK, then a long wait at the passenger loading and unloading zone at SFO and in between there was a long flight, I run the business end of this company, he's a house guest living rent-free on a generous grant from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

SEAN
How's the business end going? I see you got some big ticket ad buys lined up.

EDUARDO
Look--

SEAN
The Harvard Bartending Course, the Seneca Club's Red Party and the Mather House annual "Lather Dance". You're just one small step away from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.

EDUARDO
(to MARK)
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?

MARK
Sure.

SEAN

Don't worry about it, it's just from the pot.

How's it going? How's the internship? How's Jenny?

EDUARDO
How's the internship?

MARK
Yeah.

EDUARDO
Mark...Jesus, I quit the internship. We've talked about this on the phone, were you even--I quit on my first day.

MARK
I do remember you saying that.

EDUARDO
Yeah, it was a pretty big deal.

MARK
How's Jenny?

EDUARDO
jenny's psycho.

MARK
That can be fun.

EDUARDO
No I mean she's actually psychotic. She's insanely jealous and she's Irrational and she's violent.

MARK
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.

EDUARDO
I do not want that guy representing himself as part of this company,

MARK
You gotta move out here, Wardo, this is where it's all happening,

EDUARDO
Did you hear what I just said?

MARK
The connections, the energy--

EDUARDO

EDUARDO
He's not part of the company.

MARK

EDUARDO
I'm aware of that, Mark, I'm the CFO.

MARK
We need more servers than I ever imagined we'd need. We need more programmers. We need more money. He set up the Thiel meeting. He's set up meetings all around town.

EDUARDO
He's set up other meetings?

MARK
Yes.

A summer sub-let. A studio apartment the size of a small tool, shed.

EDUARDO is asleep on top of the covers in the un-air conditioned apartment when he wakes up to the sound of a key in the door.

One lock un-locks, then another--

EDUARDO
Hello?

The door opens and JENNY is framed by the dingy light of the hallway.

EDUARDO
Jesus.

JENNY
When did you get back?

EDUARDO
You scared me. I need you to knock first.

JENNY
When did you get back?

EDUARDO
I got back this afternoon.

JENNY
And when were you going to call me?

EDUARDO
Jen, it was kind of a rough trip and I was tired and--

JENNY
Or answer one of my 47 texts? Did you know I sent 47 texts?

EDUARDO
I did, and I thought that was incredibly normal behavior.

JENNY
Are you mocking me?

EDUARDO
I brought you a present.

JENNY
Why does your status say "single" on your Facebook page?

EDUARDO

Why does your relationship status say "single" on your Facebook page?

I--
JENNY

What?!

EDUARDO
I don't know how.

JENNY
Do I look stupid to you?

EDUARDO
No. Calm down.

JENNY
You're asking me to believe that the CFO of Facebook doesn't know how to change his relationship status on Facebook?

EDUARDO
It's a little embarrassing so you should take it as a sign of trust that I would tell you that.

JENNY
Fuck you, Wardo.

EDUARDO
calming

Easy.

JENNY
You didn't change it so you could fuck Silicon Valley skanks every time you go out to see Mark.

EDUARDO
That is not even remotely true and I can promise you that the Silicon Valley skanks don't care what anyone's relationship status is on Facebook. Please let me give you your present.

EDUARDO'S cell phone RINGS--

JENNY
Oh, your phone does work.

EDUARDO reaches for his cell but JENNY grabs it first to check the ID.

JENNY

JENNY tosses the still ringing phone back to him—

EDUARDO
Okay, this is gonna be tricky. Here, open your present. It's a silk scarf.

JENNY
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

EDUARDO
I did--

MARK
You froze the account.

EDUARDO
I had to get your attention, Mark.

MARK
Do you realize that you jeopardized the entire company? Do you realize that your actions could have easily destroyed everything I've been working on?

EDUARDO
We've been working on.

MARK
Without money, the company can't function.

What EDUARDO can't see behind his back is that JENNY has taken the gift box and lit it on fire with a cigarette lighter.

MARK
If the servers are down for even a day, our reputation is damaged irreversibly.. Users are fickle. Friendster has proven that fact.

And JENNY'S now dropped the flaming cardboard box into the wastebasket where the fire grows larger. She casually kicks the basket over with her foot.

EDUARDO
Look--

MARK
Even a small exodus, even a few people leaving would reverberate through the whole user base; The users are interconnected, that's the whole fucking point! College kids are online because their friends are online and if one domino--

Did you like being nothing?! Did you like being nobody?! Did you like being a pasty-faced geek?! You wanna go back to that?!

EDUARDO
I'm putting you on speaker.

EDUARDO hits a button on his cell and tosses it down. We'll keep hearing MARK'S-voice as EDUARDO runs out into the hallway, grabs a fire extinguisher from its wall bracket, comes back in and sprays out the fire.

MARK
That was the act of a child, not a businessman. And it certainly wasn't the act of a friend. You know how embarrassed I was when I tried to cash a check? And I was with a girl, Wardo. It happened in front of a girl. I'm not going back to that life.

EDUARDO
shouting

Yeah!

MARK
Okay, maybe you were angry, maybe you were frustrated. I'm ready to let, uh, to let bygones be bygones because I've got some good news.

EDUARDO—with the fire now out—picks up the phone.

EDUARDO
I'm sorry. It maybe was angry and it was childish. I needed to get your attention.

I said I've got some good news.

EDUARDO

MARK
Peter Thiel's just made an angel investment of a half a million dollars

EDUARDO

MARK
A half a million dollars and he's setting us up in an office. They want to re-incorporate the company, they want to meet you and they need your signature on some documents so get your ass on the next flight back to San Francisco. I need my CFO.

We can see through the glass that MARK is working at a computer nearby, SEAN is also hovering in the background,

LAWYER
Four documents, These two are common stock purchase agreements allowing you to buy stock in the newly re-incorporated Facebook instead of the old stock which is now worthless, The third is the exchange agreement, that's for exchanging your old shares for new shares and this is the voter holding agreement.

How many shares of stock will I own?

LAWYER
1,328,334.

EDUARDO
Jesus Christ.

LAWYER
That's a 34.4% ownership share. Why the rise from the original 30%?

Because you may need to dilute it to award shares to new investors,

EDUARDO (V.O.)
I didn't know whether to dress for the party or the business meeting so I kind of dressed for both.

We see that most of the employees, especially the women, are dressed to go to an after-work, late-night party.

ASHLEIGH's sat on the bed and unbuttoned her top so that she's in just a bra. She's offering her chest as a surface off of which to snort cocaine.

GIRL
Alright!

The GIRL taps out some coke from a vial onto ASHLEIGH's chest and starts passing around a rolled up 20-dollar bill for everyone to have a turn and she herself will unbutton her shirt too for the same purpose. All this while SEAN is talking.

SEAN
The next transformative development? A picture sharing application. A place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life. It is the true...digitalization of real life. You don't just go to a party anymore, you go to a party with your digital camera and your friends relive the party on Facebook. And tagging. The idea that you could tag anyone you wanted in those pictures so that people could find themselves. Then a digital log of every change in a person's life, broadcast to all their friends instantaneously.

POLICE with flashlights walk in—the beams of light streaking across the darkened party floor and the faces.

We HEAR muffled murmurs from the cops of "party's over" and "step to the side" and "nobody's leaving just yet", etc.

SEAN bolts back into--

POLICEMAN
Ladies, I need you to put your shirts on.

One of the policemen casually takes SEAN's hand and sees that his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard. The cop uses his finger to taste what it is.

SEAN
Yeah, that isn't mine.

POLICEMAN
Okay, could you all stay where you are.

And the handcuffs start to come out and we've got a room of terrified children.

I'm 17, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

SEAN closes, his eyes at hearing this news as we HEAR the sound of the cuffs lock around his wrists and we

INT. NEW FACEBOOK OFFICES - NIGHT

A digital LED clock on the wall tells us it's 4:40AM.

MARK is sitting at his computer alone. No one else is in the office. The San Francisco skyline is beautiful outside the floor-to-ceiling glass.

His cell phone RINGS and he answers.

MARK
(into phone)
Hello?

INTERCUT WITH:

= 

EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

SEAN, freezing with.no coat on, is sitting on the bottom of the steps to the police station. The LAWYER we've seen before is standing in back of him.

SEAN
(into phone)
Listen, something's happened.

We see MARK, listening on his end but can't hear SEAN's end of the conversation.

MARK
(pause)
Shit.

SEAN
It's alright, it's gonna be alright. I've posted bond and I wasn't doing anything. I mean, I've got allergies so I can't--

We're back, on MARK'S side. He listens... listens...

MARK
17?

Back on SEAN's side--

SEAN
I think it was Moritz. I swear, I think, it was Michael Moritz.

MARK
evenly

This is gonna be news, Sean, it's gonna be online any second.

SEAN
(beat)
I know.

MARK
blank

You know with an underage intern and—

SEAN
It's cool, I've got it under control.

MARK
no panic

I'll get it under control, I'll call our guys and see what the next move is. But this is gonna be news now.

SEAN
You think it was Moritz? 'Cause I do. And I'm gonna meet that guy in a dark alley one night. Or Eduardo? Did Eduardo have me followed?

MARK
cool as ice

Go home, Sean. I'll call our people.

MARK clicks the phone shut. He sits there a moment.

He looks at the small package, that Ashleigh dropped on his desk earlier. He opens up the brown paper wrapping and there's a box.

He opens the box a thousand brand new business cards. He takes one of the business cards out and looks at it.

I'm CEO...Bitch

And over this we HEAR a woman's voice...

MARYLIN (V.O.)
Mark?

CUT TO:

= 

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - NIGHT

MARK is sitting alone.in the conference room. The only one left is MARYLIN, .whose voice we just, heard. The lights of the San Francisco skyline fill the huge picture windows.

MARYLIN
Mark?

MARK looks up at her...

MARYLIN
Everyone's gone.

MARK doesn't say anything...

MARYLIN
We're done for the day,

MARK
(pause)
Who would you rather be?

MARYLIN
I'm sorry?

MARK
My Lawyer or their lawyer?

MARYLIN
smiles

Something tells me over the long run there's more money in being your lawyer. What happened to Sean?

MARK
He cashed out most of his stock. Hey listen, all you had all day was that salad. You want to get something to eat?

MARYLIN
I can't.

MARK
I'm not a bad guy.

MARYLIN
I know that. I like you.

MARK
What happens now?

MARYLIN
Sy and the rest of them are at the Palm having a steak. Then they'll come back up to the office and start working on a settlement agreement to present to you.

MARK
They're gonna want to settle?

MARYLIN
Oh yeah. And you're gonna have to pay some bonus money too.

MARK
Why?

MARYLIN
'Cause you're gonna need these guys to sign a non-disclosure agreement and you're gonna need to be indemnified. They say one unflattering word about you in public and you own their house, wife and kids.

MARK
I invented Facebook.

MARYLIN
I'm talking about what a jury'll see. That's what I do, that's what I'm doing here. I'm trying to specialize in voir dire, jury selection. Clothes, hair, wedding ring, speaking style, likability—

MARK
Likability?

MARYLIN
I've been licensed to practice law for all of 20 months and I could get a jury to believe you planted the story about Eduardo. You know how? Just by asking the question. Watch. Why weren't you at the sorority party that night?

MARK
You think I'm the one who called the police?

MARYLIN
Doesn't matter. I asked the question and now everybody's thinking about it. You lost the jury in the first 10 minutes.

MARK
(pause)
Farm animals?

MARYLIN
Yeah.

MARK
I was drunk and angry and stupid.

MARYLIN
And blogging.
(pause)
Pay the fine. Get your parking validated. Get out of it. That's what Sy and the guys'll tell you in the morning.

MARK
Would anyone mind if I stayed and used the computer for a minute?

MARYLIN
No. There's a night guy downstairs. Stay as long as you want.

MARK
Thanks. I appreciate your help today.

MARYLIN
You're not an asshole, Mark. You just want to be.

MARYLIN, who's been putting on her coat, takes her briefcase and exits.

MARK sits down at the computer. He logs on to Facebook.

He types a name in the search box: "Erica Albright".

Erica's name and picture come up, along with Boston.

University, '07. Mark smiles. She's on Facebook.

He moves the mouse back and forth between two boxes: "Send a Message" and "Add as a Friend".

He clicks on "Add as a Friend".

A box comes up that reads: "Your request to add Erica Albright as a friend has been sent."

Then MARK clicks to his homepage and waits for the response.

And waits...

MARK waits ...

And waits...

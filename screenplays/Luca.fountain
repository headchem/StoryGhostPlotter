EXT. LIGURIAN SEA - NIGHT - PROLOGUE

A small FISHING BOAT exits the harbor of PORTOROSSO, a Ligurian seaside town.

Onboard, a gramophone plays a 1950s pop song. An Italian flag flutters in the breeze. The boat's wake cuts the deep inky blue of the ocean, as lights glimmer on the waves.

On the boat, TWO FISHERMEN. One old, one young. The old one (TOMMASO) steers while the young one (GIACOMO) frets--

GIACOMO
Listen, Tommaso--do we really need to fish near the island?

TOMMASO
You worry too much.

Giacomo points downward--

At a fascinating old illustrated MAP of the Ligurian Sea, featuring all manner of sea monsters. He points his finger near ISOLA DEL MARE, the island they're heading towards.

GIACOMO
I dunno. ...What if the old stories are true?

TOMMASO
Oh, c'mon, Giacomo. You really believe in sea monsters?

GIACOMO
Too many strange things have been seen in these waters.

TOMMASO
They're all just stories. Tall tales to keep us away from a great fishing spot.

GIACOMO
But, Tommaso! —-

TOMMASO
We're fine. Non preoccupare ti, Giacomo.

Tommaso cuts the engine, and changes the record on the gramophone. Puccini. O mio babbino caro.

TOMMASO
That's more like it.

As the aria fills the night air, they pull in their nets--

While some scaly shadowy something approaches. (This is ALBERTO. We won't really meet him until later.)

Its FIN knifes through the water as it closes in on the boat--

Oh. It's not here to murder them. It's here to steal stuff.

As the fishermen go about their business, oblivious, the thing swipes a WRENCH, a DRINKING GLASS, PLAYING CARDS--

But as it reaches a skinny purple arm for the gramophone--

GIACOMO
AAAH! What is that!?

Our scampish little sea monster has been spotted.

TOMMASO
Per mille sardine--

The figure dives into the water--and right into the fishermen's net. It STRUGGLES, getting more tangled--

A lantern smashes on the deck--the light goes out--the panicked fishermen try to reel him in--

GIACOMO
(straining efforts)
Tira, tira!

The boat lists to one side as the tug-of-war intensifies--

Desperate to escape, the sea monster reverses direction and BREACHES THE SURFACE--

It arcs over the fishermen--astonished, they stumble backwards, knocking the gramophone into the water——

The sea monster dives into the water on the opposite side-- Giacomo, shaking, throws a harpoon after him, but misses——

And the sea monster is gone.

TOMMASO
(panting)
You missed! Let's go--before it comes back for us--

GIACOMO
I told you they were real!

TOMMASO
Oh, what a monster. Horrifying...

The gramophone and other objects from the boat SINK into the murky depths of the ocean as ominous music BUILDS--

SMASH TO:

LUCA, 12 an adorable and not remotely frightening SEA MONSTER BOY, freaking out:

LUCA
Aaaaaaaahhh!!!!

EXT. PAGURO HOME - MORNING

WIDE--he is in front of some kind of UNDERSEA BARN. Its doors are open and no one is inside.

He whirls to see his family's herd/school of GOATFISH dispersed all over the pastoral undersea landscape, snacking on inappropriate things.

LUCA
Fish out of the barn. FISH OUT OF THE BARN. Mom's gonna kill me-—

One of the goatfish bleats, like a goat, then zips away--

LUCA,
Caterina! --Wait!!

EXT. OUTSIDE THE BRANZINOS' HOME - BRISK CUTS OF LUCA CHASING DOWN GOATFISH

Luca tears past a SEA MONSTER FARMER, startling him in the middle of feeding his crabs-- 

LUCA
Good morning, Mr. Branzino! And also, I'm sorry. And, uh. How's Mrs. Branzino?

MR. BRANZINO
(unamused)
Hi, Luca.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE GAMBERETTOS' HOME
Luca timidly approaches another stolid sea monster farmer--

LUCA
Excuse me, ma'am? Have you, by any chance--

MRS. GAMBERETTO
(severely)
Yes.

She rotates. A goatfish is nibbling the back of her head.

EXT. HILLSIDE
Luca races up a hill after--

LUCA
Giuseppe! Get back here!!

--one last goatfish (GIUSEPPE) nosing his way up the hill, in the direction of the surface. Luca jumps on him; Giuseppe squirms free. Some greased-pig shenanigans. Finally Luca gets him under an arm, and scolds him as he heads back down-—

LUCA
You wanna run off like your buddy Enrico? Because I've got news for you: he's either dead, or he's...
(thinking about it)
...out there somewhere.
(a little dreamily)
Seeing the world.

Beat.

LUCA
(snapping out of it)
But he's probably dead!

They return to the now-assembled flock--

LUCA
Okay. That's everyone.
(knowingly )
Monalisa...? Why are you smiling?

MONALISA has kind of a creepy smile. She opens her mouth and a smaller fish wrestles its way out of there.

LUCA
Anyone else in there?

A few more fish emerge from Monalisa's mouth.

LUCA
Giuseppe, what did we JUST talk about.

Giuseppe, who has begun straying from the herd a little, FREEZES.

Then he continues straying from the herd a little more.

LUCA
(to the school)
All right--Let's head out--

SEA MONSTER FARMERS attend to their labors, surrounded by the fields, farms, homes, and silos of a PEACEFUL AGRARIAN UNDERSEA COMMUNITY--

Luca exchanges warm polite greetings with many of them--

LUCA
Hello!

MR. GAMBERETTO^
Good morning!

LUCA
Hi, Mrs. Aragosta.

MRS. ARAGOSTA^
Hey, Luca!

LUCA
Good morning!

MR. MERLUZZO^
Morning!

Sea monsters: not quite how we imagine them.

PAN TO:

EXT. UNDERWATER FIELD
Luca corrals the goatfish flock toward a PASTURE--

LUCA
Ok. All clear.

The fish start grazing, and Luca settles in for another not-super-stimulating day.

LUCA
(to the fish)
Let me know if you need anything.
Anyone?
No?

Luca sits on a ROCK and blows bubbles from his mouth, bored.

Hmm. Giuseppe is sniffing at something--

LUCA
Giuseppe?

--an ALARM CLOCK. Luca, intrigued, picks it up. What is this? It goes off, terrifying him, then mercifully stops.

There's more--he spots a PLAYING CARD floating nearby--

He examines it, then looks up to contemplate the alien world that these things must have fallen from--

And spots a BOAT OVERHEAD--

LUCA
LAND MONSTERS!
EVERYBODY UNDER THE ROCK!

Luca herds the scattered goatfish into a small CAVE--this is a familiar drill.

They remain as the boat passes, not seeing them--

And as Luca watches it get farther away-- HE BEGINS TO FOLLOW.

As he approaches the surface, the fascinating world up there comes into view--he tries to poke his head through, but the water BULGES unnaturally with his head, keeping him in the water--he strains to see what there is to see--

DANIELA (O.S.)
LUCA!
LUNCH IS READY!

Luca's mom's voice shatters his DAYDREAM, which was all it was--he's actually just a few feet off the sea floor.

LUCA
(stressed)
BE RIGHT THERE! !

Luca scrambles to hide his clock and cards, and collect the herd--

LUCA
Come on! We gotta get back--

EXT. PAGURO HOME - LUNCHTIME

Luca swims home. His mom, DANIELA--loving, warm, overbearing-- is on him.

DANIELA
You're two minutes late. Was there a boat?! Huh?! Did you hide?!

LUCA
(dutiful but weary)
Yes, Mom.

DANIELA
Because if they catch even a glimpse of you--you think they come around to meet new friends? Huh? Make small talk about the current? No. They're here to do MURDERS. Just making sure you know.

LUCA^
Uh-huh.
No.
I don't.
Uh-huh.
Thanks Mom.

They head into their cozy little undersea farmhouse, as Daniela reminisces about how things have changed--

DANIELA
When I was a kid, we'd go weeks without seeing a boat. And let me tell you, they did not have motors. Just a sweaty land monster with a paddle.

GRANDMA, prickly, irascible, sits at the table. Even if Luca wasn't her only grandchild, he'd be her favorite.

LUCA
(giving her a kiss)
Hi, Grandma.

GRANDMA
Hey, Bubble.

Luca's dad, LORENZO, is a little too into his show crabs, our sea monster equivalent of prize-winning chickens. He is attending to one now named PINCHY-PESSA.

LUCA
Hi, Dad.

LORENZO
(whispering, awestruck)
Luca. Look at Pinchy-pessa. She's molting. Oh, it's magnificent. Now here's a champion show crab if I ever saw one.

LUCA
(trying to be interested)
Oh. Nice.

LORENZO
Whoa whoa whoa! Don't look her in the eye!

LUCA
Sorry!

LORENZO
But don't apologize! She can sense weakness! !

Sure enough, Pinchy-pessa PINCHES Luca's ear.

Daniela uses her tail to scoop up the crab and orders Luca to the table.

DANIELA
Come eat, Luca. C'mon.
(to Lorenzo)
We better beat those Branzinos at the crab show this year. Everyone thinks Bianca Branzino's so great. With her prize-winning crabs and amaaaazing dolphin impression. Please! Everyone has a dolphin impression! ECK ECK ECK ECK ECK ECK.
I mean, right?

LORENZO
Why do dolphins even sound like that? Why don't they just talk?

Luca's thoughts are back on the pasture--Grandma notices--

GRANDMA
Luca, what's on your mind?

LUCA
I... Well, I was just wondering... where do boats come from?

Lorenzo SPIT-TAKES.

GRANDMA
The land monster town. Just above the surface. I beat a guy at cards there once.

DANIELA
Mom! What are you doing?!

GRANDMA
(shrugs )
He's old enough to hear about it.

LUCA
(floored)
You've been to the surface?! And-- and done the change?!

DANIELA
Nope! Nope! The end! Shut it down!

LUCA
I was just curious--

DANIELA
And the curious fish gets caught! We do not talk, think, discuss, contemplate, or go ANYWHERE near the surface. Got it?

LUCA
(cowed)
Yes, Mom.

Daniela hands Luca the rest of his lunch--

DANIELA
Here. Now let's get back to work.

She watches him get his crook, a little wistfully.

DANIELA
Hey. Look me in the eye. You know I love you, right?

LUCA
(softening)
I know, Mom.

She watches him head out with the flock.

DANIELA
(to Lorenzo)
We're a little worried about him, right?

LORENZO
(completely disengaged)
No thanks! I'm full!

EXT. FIELDS

Luca is hunting more and more fascinating human objects. They carry him farther and father out of the pasture.

A shiny WRENCH--

A drinking glass--

And there, in the distance-- The GRAMOPHONE from our prologue.

Fascinated, cautious, he approaches it.

Too distracted to notice the ominous FIGURE IN A DIVING SUIT, STEALTHILY CLOSING IN BEHIND HIM--

Luca turns--

The diver hefts his harpoon--Luca, scrambling to get away, blunders into a rock--

**HE'S CORNERED--**

ALBERTO
Boo.

LUCA
HUH?

The diver takes off its helmet to reveal that IT'S ANOTHER SEA MONSTER BOY (ALBERTO, 14).

Alberto is a rule-breaker, insouciant, carefree and careless. Your parents might think he's a bad kid, but you know he doesn't mean anyone any harm.

ALBERTO
It's fine! I'm not human.

LUCA
Oh!
(still kind of terrified)
...Thank goodness!

Before Luca can stop this from happening, Alberto hands him his harpoon.

ALBERTO
Here, hold this.

Luca very gingerly takes hold of it and watches Alberto begin to collect all of the human items that have fallen here--

LUCA
Uhhh. Do you... live around here?

ALBERTO
Down here? No no no. I just came for my stuff.

Alberto picks up Luca's CROOK, too--

ALBERTO
Ooooh!

And bolts for the surface before Luca can stop him-

LUCA
Hey. Wait! That's mine!

Luca HURRIES AFTER HIM, only managing to catch up once Alberto is near the surface.

LUCA
Sir? You forgot your harpoon. And if I could just--

ALBERTO
Oh yeah. Thanks.

Alberto grabs the harpoon and just WALKS OUT OF THE WATER.

LUCA
Wha?? What are you doing?!

Luca, in shock, stares through the water--he can't totally make out what's happening--

Then the CROOK sticks back through the surface.

And hooks Luca and pulls him out of the water, too.

LUCA
GAAAAH!

EXT. BEACH - DAY
Alberto, now in human form, hauls Luca up onto the sand--

Luca's hand quickly begins to TRANSFORM--then his arms, his body, his face--he has HAIR--

Luca COMPLETELY FREAKS OUT. He thinks he might be dying.

LUCA
AAAAAAHHH! No no! OH NO!! AAAH!!

HELP ME

>SMASH TO WIDE:

He is not dying. He is a small human boy rolling around yelling on the sand for seemingly no reason.

ALBERTO
First time?

LUCA
Of course it is!! I'm a good kid!

Alberto realizes he needs to walk him through this a little.

ALBERTO
Hey. Relax. Breathe.

Luca takes a couple breaths. Sure enough, he begins to relax.

He looks around.

He takes in the sights and sounds of the surface. The shore. The trees. The grass. The sky.

Things he has spent his entire young life wondering about.

Alberto watches, amused.

ALBERTO
Well? Isn't it great?

This snaps Luca out of it--

LUCA
Uh! No! It's bad! I'm not supposed to be up here!
--Good day!

Luca scrambles into the water.

Alberto picks up Luca's crook and holds it out right as Luca comes back for it, flustered--

LUCA
(angry polite)
Thank you.
Good day.
...Again.

INT. PAGURO HOME - LUCA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Luca can't sleep. He glances across the room at Grandma. She gazes back at him.

He needs to ask SOMEONE about what he saw.

LUCA
Grandma?
...Did you really go up to the--

GRANDMA
SNORE.

Ah. Grandma was asleep with her eyes open. She does that.

EXT. FIELDS - NEXT MORNING

Luca assembles a crude rock sculpture that is supposed to look like him.

LUCA
(to the fish)
Okay everyone. This is, uh... smuca. Yeah. He's in charge now. Got it? Great.

EXT. NEAR THE SURFACE

And, his responsibility discharged for the moment, Luca returns to the surface, fascinated but apprehensive——

He stops a few feet away. Fear overtakes him. He backs away, shaking his head.

He approaches again, gets pretty close to the surface, and once more backs away at the last minute--

And again--

ALBERTO
Wow.

Luca whirls. Alberto has been watching this whole embarrassing thing.

ALBERTO
That was hard to watch.

He is holding another armful of stuff. He hands some to Luca--

ALBERTO
Here. C'mon.

Alberto exits. Luca holds his breath, and hurries after him--

EXT. BEACH

--in time to see Alberto finish transforming, flipping the water out of his hair. Luca STUMBLES after him, dropping everything he was holding.

For the second time in his life, Luca TRANSFORMS. This time he really takes it all in. So this is The Change.

LUCA
WHOA.

He absently reaches for his tail--

LUCA
Wait. It feels like it's still there--

ALBERTO
Yeah, that's called "phantom tail." You'll get used to it.

Luca tries to stand and immediately falls over.

ALBERTO
Right. Walking.
Don't worry! You're in luck. I basically invented walking. To start, stack everything one on top of the other. Like a pile of rocks.

Luca manages to stand in a WOBBLY way.

ALBERTO
Great! I mean, not great. But, fine. Now, walking is just like swimming. But without fins. Or a tail. Also there's no water. Otherwise it's the exact same thing!

Luca tries to follow this advice and completely eats it.

ALBERTO
Uh. That's not it. Try it again.
(Luca fails again)
Hmm. Try to lead with your head?
(Luca looks insane)
Nope. More belly.
(Luca falls down)
That's, ah... that's just lying on the ground. How about this: Take a step without even thinking about it.

Luca hesitates. He's clearly thinking about it.

ALBERTO
No no no no. DON'T think about it!

LUCA
I don't know how to NOT think about something!

This is going nowhere. But Alberto gets an idea--

ALBERTO
Okay, okay. Watch.
(positioning Luca)
Point your feet to where you want to go. Okay? And then just catch yourself before you fall.

Luca follows his example. He points his feet and gets up.

ALBERTO
That's right...

Alberto gives him a NUDGE--and Luca starts WALKIN

ALBERTO
Good... good... yes. YES!

LUCA
I'm getting it!

Luca's first success on land. It feels pretty good.

ALBERTO
Not bad, kid.
(introducing himself)
Alberto Scorfano.

LUCA
Luca Paguro.

Alberto leads Luca through a confusing HANDSHAKE--

ALBERTO
Piacere, Girolamo Trombetta.
(off Luca's bafflement)
It's a human thing. I'm kind of an expert.

LUCA
What does it mean?

Alberto does not reply right away.

LUCA
The, uh... thing you just said? With the handshake?—- ALBERTO
(interrupting)
C'mon, I'1l show you some more stuff.

EXT. ISLAND - HILL - DAY
Alberto leads Luca through the trees, up the hill--

To the base of an ABANDONED SARACEN TOWER. A rickety ladder leans against the side.

LUCA
Mother of pearl. You live up here?

ALBERTO
Yeah. Me and my dad. He's not even here a whole lot, so I pretty much just do whatever I want.

LUCA
Isn't it dangerous?

ALBERTO
Yeah! It's the best. EVERYTHING good is above the surface.

LUCA,
Like... what else?

!MONTAGE OF GREAT ABOVE-THE-SURFACE THINGS:

!1. AIR.

ALBERTO
Air!

Alberto does a BIG INHALE. So does Luca. He accidentally inhales a bug.

!2. GRAVITY. Alberto, on the top of the tower, yells down to Luca, on the ground:

ALBERTO
Gravity! Also known as: FALLIIIING

Luca watches Alberto jump down into a tree, fall through some branches, and then land on the ground, bruised and giddy.

!3. THE SKY.

ALBERTO
(pointing)
The sky, clouds, the sun--
(covering Luca's eyes)
Whoa, don't look at it!
(uncovering Luca's eyes)
Just kidding. Definitely look at it.

Luca squints at the sun and is immediately blinded. 4. HUMAN STUFF.

ALBERTO
And then there's human stuff.

Alberto leads Luca into his hideout--

INT. ALBERTO'S HIDEOUT

Luca takes in the incredible, wildly disorderly spectacle of Alberto's room. It contains AN UNGODLY AMOUNT OF HUMAN STUFF. Rusty, broken, salvaged from shipwrecks.

LUCA
WHOA.

ALBERTO
I've been collecting for a long time. Ask me anything.

Luca spots the gramophone and gazes into it--

ALBERTO
Ah yes, the Magic Singing Lady Machine. It's broken, unfortunately...

As Alberto is saying this, Luca discovers the CRANK, fiddles with it, and--

MUSIC comes out. The Puccini aria. O mio babbino caro.

Alberto is momentarily at a loss for words. This kid did something cool.

ALBERTO
Whoa! You unbroke it!

Luca's attention settles on a VESPA POSTER--

LUCA
What's that?

ALBERTO
(recovering bravado)
That? Just the greatest thing that humans ever made. The Vespa. You sit on it, and it takes you anywhere you want to go. *In the whole stinkin' world*.

Luca, rapt, reads the Italian on the poster:

LUCA
"Vespa is freedom."

DISSOLVE TO HIS IMAGINATION: Luca flies over the sea, gloriously, on a fantastic magical VESPA--

LUCA
Whoo!! Yeah! !

ALBERTO (O.S.)
Pretty cool, right?

Alberto's voice brings Luca back to REALITY.

LUCA
Yeah.

And gazing around the hideout, Luca gets an idea--

LUCA
Are you gonna make one? I think you have all the parts...

Alberto follows his gaze around the room and realizes--that thing is a wheel, that thing is another wheel, that rocking chair could be a seat...

ALBERTO
I do have the parts. I AM gonna make one!! You wanna help?

LUCA
(delighted)
Me?! Yeah!
(remembering)
Wait. No. I can't. I gotta go home!

ALBERTO
Right this second?

LUCA
Yeah. If my parents found out I was up here...
(cringing)
It would be bad. So thank you, but.
(staring longingly at the Vespa poster)
Goodbye. Forever.

CARD: **One hour later**.

Luca has not left. Instead he has begun making the Vespa with Alberto.

LUCA
Okay but now I really do have to go.

ALBERTO
Okay. Bye.

Card: **Forty-five minutes later**. Now it has wheels.

LUCA
Seriously, I have to go, like now. Like right now.

ALBERTO
Okay! See you!

Card: **Two hours later**. Their improvised Vespa, made from 100% NON-VESPA parts, is done. They admire it, dreamily.

LUCA
It's even better than the picture.

ALBERTO
Yeah it is.

LUCA
Gotta run!

ALBERTO
See you tomorrow!

EXT. PAGURO HOME - DUSK - CONTINUOUS

Luca races home--

INT. PAGURO HOME - DINNER
But his suspicious mom is waiting for him in the kitchen.

DANIELA
Luca?! Where have you been?!

LUCA
(rushed)
Uhh...

LUCA'S THOUGHTS
Don't say surface. Don't say surface.

LUCA
Surface.

He claps his hand over his mouth--

DANIELA
(narrowing eyes)
WHAT did you just say?!

LORENZO
(pointing)
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIS FOOT?!!

Luca looks down--

!ONE OF HIS FEET IS STILL A HUMAN FOOT SOMEHOW--

LUCA
AAAAAHHH!!!

SMASH BACK TO:

The last ten seconds was just his IMAGINATION. Thank God. But his mom is still waiting for an answer--

DANIELA
Luca? Gonna tell us where you were?

LUCA
I...Uhh...

Grandma comes to the rescue.

GRANDMA
It's my fault. I sent him to look for sea cucumbers.

LUCA
(catching on quick)
RIGHT. Sorry, Grandma. Couldn't find em!

DANIELA
Mom. His life is maybe a little more important than your snacks? 

Grandma shrugs. The heat is off Luca. For now. He mouths a "Thank you" to her.

INT. LUCA'S BEDROOM
Luca can't sleep. He just had the greatest day of his life.

And tomorrow might be even better.

EXT. HILLTOP - NEXT DAY

Luca is amazed to find the Vespa now outside the tower, at the top of the hill--

LUCA
Whoa! How'd you get it down?

ALBERTO
(bragging)
I RODE it down.

Beat. Alberto, how would that even work.

ALBERTO
(admitting the truth)
I didn't. I pushed it out the back window. Took a while to put back together. But it's fine now! You ready to ride it?

Alberto gestures DOWN A DIZZYINGLY STEEP HILL. A little WOODEN RAMP sits at the bottom.

LUCA
Ah. Well, thank you, but, no thank you.
(beat)
I mean I just think maybe I would die.

ALBERTO
(shrugging)
Okay, I'll ride it. You hold the ramp.

EXT. BOTTOM OF HILL

Now under the ramp at the bottom of the hill, Luca tries not to freak out--

LUCA
--Sir? Maybe we should sleep on it?

--as Alberto mounts the Vespa, high above him--

ALBERTO
Whatever you do, do not move!

LUCA
(panicking)
I'm not the guy you want for this! I'm more of an idea man--

ALBERTO
(triumphantly)
TAKE ME, GRAVITYYYYYYYY

And with that glorious cry, Alberto kicks off--

And races down the hill toward Luca.

Almost immediately, the Vespa hits a rock and breaks in half. Alberto, now riding the front half like a unicycle, continues hurtling toward Luca--

ALBERTO
THIS IS NORMAL. STAY FOCUSED.

Pieces of the Vespa come tumbling past Luca--he ducks behind the ramp--

And peeks out to see Alberto tumble off the last remaining Vespa wheel and begin VIOLENTLY SOMERSAULTING TOWARD HIM--

LUCA
AAAAAAAHHH

ALBERTO
DON'T MOVE DON'T MOVE DON'T MOVE.

Luca ducks back under the ramp just as Alberto ROLLS over it-- Is suspended in the air for a glorious moment--

CRASHES into the water--

And just kinda floats there.

LUCA,
He's dead. I killed him.

Alberto lifts his skinny sea monster fists to the heavens.

ALBERTO
WOOOOHOOO!! HA HA HA!!

LUCA
That was... good?!

ALBERTO
Did you see the height I got?! Hey. Nice ramping. Come on, let's build another one-- Alberto pats Luca on the back-- A BIG DUMB SMILE floods Luca's face--

!--BEGIN MONTAGE--

EXT. HILLTOP - DAY

Luca and Alberto begin assembling another Vespa, with more fun human items--Alberto swings a buoy around joyously and accidentally bonks himself in the head--

INT. HIDEOUT - LATER

Alberto gives Luca some AWESOME HUMAN CLOTHES.

EXT. HIDEOUT

Luca and Alberto GROOVE to some TUNES--

EXT. HILLTOP

Alberto rides another janky Vespa down the hill as Luca, under the ramp again, is attacked by a seagull--

EXT. FIELDS - UNDERWATER - QUICK CUT

Daniela glances from distance at Luca's pasture to check on him--she is fooled by the silhouette of SMUCA.

EXT. ISOLA DEL MARE
Alberto does a fearless graceful CLIFF DIVE--

ALBERTO
(from the water)
C'mon, Luca!

Luca tries to do the same, but fear takes over--

LUCA
AAAAAAAHHH--

--and he ends up doing more of a brutal CLIFF BELLY FLOP.

EXT. FIELDS - UNDERWATER - QUICK CUT

Uh oh. Daniela discovers Smuca--

And Lorenzo finds Luca's cache of human trinkets--

INT. HIDEOUT

Luca and Alberto diagram a Vespa with charcoal--

EXT. HIDEOUT

Luca repurposes the wire hanger Alberto has been using as a back scratcher, turning it into handlebars--

EXT. FIELDS - UNDERWATER - MORNING

DANIELA and LORENZO, hiding behind rocks, watch Luca position Smuca and then swim away. So THAT'S what he's been doing.

The parents are horrified. But Daniela has a plan--

EXT. OPEN WATER - DAY

Luca and Alberto watch an ANGRY FISHERMAN shout at a passing speedboat--

ANGRY FISHERMAN
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, STUPIDO?!

EXT. GROTTO - LATE AFTERNOON
Alberto YELLS into a cave, imitating him--

ALBERTO
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, STUPIDO?!

EXT. COVE - SUNSET

Luca grabs two SEA SNAILS and uses their slime to style his hair like Alberto's, and the two gaze happily at a sunset.

!--END MONTAGE--

EXT. HILLTOP - NEXT DAY
Another day, another Vespa. But this time:

ALBERTO
We gotta ride together. If you don't sit on the back and hold on to the front, the whole thing falls apart.

LUCA
And who's holding the ramp?

ALBERTO
The turtle.

Yes. The ramp is balanced on a TURTLE.

ALBERTO
And he's faster than he looks. Let's go.

LUCA
(resolutely)
Okay. Let's go.

Beat. Luca doesn't move.

ALBERTO
You, uh... you coming?

LUCA
Nope. Can't do it. Never in a million years--

ALBERTO
Hey hey hey. I know your problem. You got a Bruno in your head.

LUCA
A Bruno?

ALBERTO
Yeah. I get one too sometimes. "Alberto, you can't. Alberto, you're gonna die. Alberto, don't put that in your mouth."
Luca, it's simple: Don't listen to stupid Bruno.

Beat, as Luca puzzles over this--

LUCA
Why is his name Bruno?

ALBERTO
I don't care. It doesn't matter. Call him whatever you want. Just shut him up. Repeat after me: SILENZIO BRUNO.

LUCA
(hesitantly)
Silenzio Bruno.

ALBERTO
Louder!
SILENZIO BRUNO!
SILENZIO BRUNO!

LUCA^
Silenzio Bruno!
Silenzio Bruno! 

ALBERTO
CAN YOU STILL HEAR HIM?!

LUCA
NOPE! JUST YOU!

Alberto physically puts Luca on the back of the Vespa--

ALBERTO
GOOD. Hang on.

Alberto checks his image in the rearview mirror (not a mirror: instead a taped photo of MARCELLO MASTROIANNI)--

And he kicks off.

ALBERTO
ANDIAMOOOOOOO--

Luca clings to Alberto, terrified, as they go HURTLING DOWN THE HILL, bouncing off loose rocks and stuff. Alberto's erratic steering mostly does not have them aimed at the ramp.

ALBERTO
(psyched)
WOOHOOOOOOOO!!! YEAH

Luca's eyes are shut tight--he opens them for a peek--the Vespa begins to FALL APART--oh God no--he shuts his eyes, grips Alberto tightly, and pulls the Vespa back together--

LUCA
(terrified muttering)
silenzio bruno silenzio bruno silenzio bruno silenzio brunoooOOOOOO--

Alberto steers them onto the ramp just in time--

ALBERTO
YAHOOOOOOOOOOOO!!

And Luca opens his eyes as they SOAR gloriously into the sky--

And takes in the SPARKLING SEA, THE CLOUDS, the SHORELINE. It's an indescribably wonderful moment. Then they begin plummeting seaward.

ALBERTO
Uh-oh.

Specifically right toward an extremely sharp-looking rock.

LUCA
AAAAAAAAAAAHHH

At the last moment, Luca, thinking quickly, SHOVES Alberto's half of the Vespa away from his half--

They become TWO PROJECTILES instead of one, and Alberto SPLASHES down safely on one side of the rock, Luca on the other.

They SURFACE--Alberto shoots his fists in the air-- Luca's disbelief quickly turns to ELATION:

ALBERTO
WHOOHOOO! YEA! Take that Bruno!

LUCA^
YES. WE'RE ALIVE. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

EXT. ROOFTOP - EVENING

Luca and Alberto lay around a CAMPFIRE, gazing at the STARS.

LUCA
What are all those tiny lights?

ALBERTO
Anchovies. They go there to sleep.

Luca is DUMBFOUNDED.

LUCA
Really?

ALBERTO
Yeah. The big fish protects them.
(pointing at the moon)
I touched it once.
(nonchalant)
I dunno. Felt like a fish.

Luca is ASTOUNDED. And a little wistful--

LUCA
Wow. Your life is so much cooler than mine. I never go anywhere. I just dream about it.

ALBERTO
You came up here!

LUCA
Thanks to you.
(gazing at stars)
Otherwise I never would have seen any of this.

His gaze travels to the HUMAN TOWN across the water.

LUCA
Have you ever gone to the human town?

ALBERTO
Yeah! All the time.
(beat. This is a lie)
No. Not even once.
But my dad told me all about it, so, I'm pretty much an expert.

LUCA
Your dad sounds so cool. You're lucky he lets you do what you want.

ALBERTO
Yeah, for sure.

A silence. Each boy is in his head.

Alberto gets them out of it.

ALBERTO
Hey, remember that time we almost hit that rock? And we flew through the air? And I was like "YEAHHH!" And you were like "NOOO! !"

It cracks Luca up.

LUCA
Wouldn't it be amazing to have a real Vespa?

ALBERTO
That's the dream.

Luca closes his eyes.

!DISSOLVE TO HIS IMAGINATION:

EXT. FIELDS - DAY
Luca and Alberto ride through the open fields on a Vespa. Little trails of smoke rising from the field alert them to--

ALBERTO
Oh, Luca, look!

A herd of UNTAMED, RIDERLESS VESPAS, like wild horses.

LUCA
Wild Vespas!

The wild Vespas ride with them toward a GIANT RAMP that goes straight into the sky.

ALBERTO
Luca, take over!

Luca climbs up front and takes control--

ALBERTO
Yeah man! Faster!!

Luca can't resist Alberto's encouragement. He guns it and shoots up the ramp, launching them into the sky--

ALBERTO
WHOOOHOOOO!

They fly among the stars, which are, indeed, LUMINOUS GOLDEN FISH.

Luca reaches out to touch one--its skin RIPPLES brilliantly--

LUCA
I'm doing it, Alberto!--

But when he looks back--Alberto has DISAPPEARED.

LUCA
Alberto?--

And everything begins turning to water-- Luca transforms back and begins falling earthward, abyssward--

LUCA
AAAAAAAHHH--

>SMASH BACK TO REALITY:

EXT. ROOFTOP - MORNING
Luca JOLTS AWAKE, on the ROOFTOP. IT WAS A DREAM--

LUCA
Oh no! I fell asleep!

ALBERTO
(groggy)
Hmm--whaa?

Luca hurries to the steps and runs off--

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Luca sneaks into his room--

His GRANDMA is snoring. WHEW.

But--WHIP PAN to DANIELA, arms folded, in the doorway--

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Luca sits guiltily at the table, holding his tail nervously. His alarm clock and playing cards are on the table.

Both parents hover over him. Daniela maintains a stony silence. Lorenzo, ever conflict-averse, hems and haws--

LORENZO
Daniela, do we really need to go through with this?

LUCA
(very worried)
With... what?

LORENZO
(struggling to take the lead)
Son, you're in big trouble. You need to promise us that you'll never sneak off to the surface again.

LUCA
I'm really sorry.
(trying for good news)
Seti Deters But you know--it's not that dangerous up there. Maybe I could show you!

DANIELA
(erupting)
I told you. Our son has a death wish!

LUCA
But Mom, we're always careful---

Luca covers his mouth, realizing his mistake--

DANIELA
"We?"

LORENZO^
"We?"

LUCA
Me and my friend. Alberto. But it's okay! He's one of us--

An angler light behind Luca switches on to reveal--

UNCLE UGO, Lorenzo's twin brother. He's been lurking here this whole time.

UNCLE UGO
Yes, there's usually a bad influence.

He is like Lorenzo but transparent-skinned, milky-eyed, and generally horrifying to behold.

UNCLE UGO
Good thing you sent for me when you did.

LORENZO
Luca, this is my brother. Your Uncle Ugo.

DANIELA
Thanks again for coming all this way on such short notice.

UNCLE UGO
Of course. Hello, Luca. It is nice to--

Ugo FREEZES. His heart has visibly stopped.

LORENZO
Luca, punch his heart.
(off Luca's hesitation)
The red thing. Punch it.

Luca gives Uncle Ugo's chest a little NUDGE.

LORENZO
Oh, way harder than that.

Luca socks Uncle Ugo in the heart. He jolts back to life.

UNCLE UGO
(coughing)
Thanks for that. Too much oxygen up here. Not like the deep. As you'll learn!

LUCA
(horrified)
...what?

UNCLE UGO
(rambling)
Sure, there's no sunlight. But there's nothing to see anyway! Or do. It's just you and your thoughts. And all the whale carcass you can eat. Little bits of it just float into your mouth. No way to stop it. Your mouth is open, the whale carcass goes in.
(beat)
Well! Come on! No time to waste!

LUCA
(panicked)
Mom? What does he mean?

DANIELA
You're going to stay with Uncle Ugo for the rest of the season.

!BOMBSHELL.

DANIELA
TWO seasons, then! Wanna go for three?!

LUCA
Why are you doing this?!

DANIELA
(terrible, vulnerable)
The world is a very dangerous place, Luca! And if I have to send you to the bottom of the ocean to keep you safe--so be it!

LUCA
You don't know what it's like up there!

DANIELA
I know YOU. And I know what's best for you. It's done.

Luca fumes bitterly. Daniela's heart breaks a little as she watches him--she needs for him to understand--

DANIELA
Hey. Look me in the eye. You know I love you, right?

Luca refuses to reply--instead he whirls and heads off to his bedroom, furious.

INT. LUCA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Luca paces his bedroom.

He glances at the window, then back at his bedroom door--

He makes a decision--and escapes out the window.

>PAN TO GRANDMA:

Who saw the whole thing.

She chuckles. Go get em, kid.

EXT. ALBERTO'S HIDEOUT - MORNING

LUCA (O.S.)
They're sending me to the deep!

INT. ALBERTO'S HIDEOUT

Luca paces, furious, as Alberto listens in disbelief--

LUCA
To live with my weird see-through uncle!! What do I do?!

ALBERTO
(hoping it's this easy)
...Stay?

LUCA
Up here? They'll come looking for me!

ALBERTO
(panicky, stalling for time)
Okay. Yes. That may be true. But---
(getting the best idea he has ever had)
--will they come looking for you over there?

Alberto is pointing to the HUMAN TOWN, across the water.

LUCA
No way. That's crazy.

ALBERTO
I mean, that place must be full of Vespas. There's gotta be one for us.

LUCA
(excited)
A real Vespa.
(second-guessing himself)
But could we even survive over there?

ALBERTO
You and me? We can do anything. We'd swim right over to Vespatown, track down Signor Vespa--

LUCA
Wait. Do you really think there's a Signor Vespa?

ALBERTO
Makes sense, right?

LUCA
Yes. Continue.

ALBERTO
And we say: "Signor Vespa! Build us one... of THESE."

Alberto pulls out a boyish SCHEMATIC of their custom Vespa drawn on a torn-out page from a book. The drawing has outlandish embellishments and an extra long seat.

LUCA
This is the greatest drawing I've ever seen.

ALBERTO
Yes. I know. Luca, think about it. Every day we'll ride someplace new. And every night we'll sleep under the fish. No one to tell us what to do. Just you and me out there. Free.

EXT. ALBERTO'S HIDEOUT - DAY
The boys run toward a cliff--

ALBERTO
TAKE ME GRAVITYYYY--

Alberto CLIFF DIVES--

Luca gets to the cliff, and as always--HESITATES. He looks out toward the human town.

LUCA
(to himself)
Silenzio Bruno.

He JUMPS--

EXT. OPEN WATER - CONTINUOUS

Luca and Alberto swim at TOP SPEED WITH MAXIMUM EXCITEMENT--

They are heading for a rock--Luca is about to avoid it but Alberto grabs him, and pulls him OUT OF THE WATER--

They ARC GRACEFULLY OVER THE ROCK, TRANSFORMING for a moment before plunging back into the water--

CUE A GLORIOUS KINETIC SEQUENCE OF LUCA AND ALBERTO swimming to town, leaping out of the water, skimming and skating across the waves--

Alberto leading the way, Luca following, coming into his own.

EXT. PORTOROSSO HARBOR - LATER

Luca and Alberto surface near a buoy.

In front of them--the human town is beautiful.

But they don't get long to admire it--a fishing boat motors by and they DIVE, but not before a girl on the boat sees something--

CHIARA
Papa? What's that?!

!UNDERWATER:

LUCA
How do we get in?

They both glance down at the SUNKEN BOAT beneath them.

EXT. COVE

An overturned boat walks out of the water, with sea monster feet underneath that quickly turn to human feet.

They've made it onto land. Alberto, all confidence, leads Luca towards town--

ALBERTO
This will be a breeze. Just don't get wet.

But Luca's panic overtakes him at the first sight of humans—- two FISHERMEN strolling toward them.

LUCA
Actually, this town seems a little crowded.

Luca tries to turn around and leave. Alberto grabs him--

ALBERTO
Hey. Silenzio Bruno.

And drags Luca past the fishermen--

ALBERTO
(inflected like "Good day to you!," flourishing with one hand)
What's wrong with you, stupido?

The fishermen stop but are too puzzled to confront them.

ALBERTO
See? You just gotta follow my lead.

The kids round the corner into the piazza--

And we stay with LUCA as his WONDER takes over.

He is awestruck by the sights and sounds of Portorosso:
Barflies sharing gossip and enjoying caffé;
A group of kids playing soccer in the PIAZZA;
Young girls eating watermelon from a balcony;
Two old guys playing cards;

CARD PLAYER
SCOPA!

It's all very ITALIAN, and very everyday. But the mundane is, to Luca, enthralling.

ALBERTO
Classic human town. Pretty cool, right?

Luca spots a couple of OLD LADIES (the ARAGOSTA SISTERS, Pinuccia and Concetta) eating two beautiful GELATO CONES.

ALBERTO
(to Luca, encouragingly)
You do it now. Just say the thing.

LUCA
(trying his best)
What's wrong with you, stupido?

Beat.

The Aragosta Sisters pummel the boys with umbrella and purse.

HARD CUT TO:

Luca and Alberto keep walking, stiffly, with gelato cones on their heads.

LUCA
Maybe I... said it wrong?

But now Luca begins taking in the ominous FRESCOES and STATUES around them, all featuring the same mustachioed man (SIGNOR GIORGIO GIORGIONI) SLAYING VARIOUS SEA MONSTERS--

Oh no. This town hates sea monsters.

LUCA
Alberto, this is too dangerous! Let's get out of here!

Luca grabs Alberto's arm and starts dragging him away.

ALBERTO
(protesting)
And go where!?

!BUT BEFORE LUCA CAN GET THEM OUT OF THERE:

They hear the unmistakable sound of an ONCOMING VESPA.

(Driven by ERCOLE, 16, lots of product in his hair.)

ALBERTO
*Signor Vespa*.

ERCOLE
Buongiorno a tuttil!

Ercole is a massive narcissist. He believes everyone in town is overjoyed to see him, which, the adults at least are not.

(He is attended by CICCIO and GUIDO, his faithful goon-like friends, who jog behind him with a large sub sandwich.)

MAGGIORE
(rolling eyes)
Mannaggia. Here we go.

PRIEST
(begging Ercole to stop)
Mamma mia. Please, no more revving.

OLD WOMAN ON BALCONY
(furious )
CHE PUZZA, ERCOLE!

ERCOLE
CIAO, CIAO!! Beep beep!! Pride of Portorosso, coming through!!
(flirty, to the Aragosta Sisters)
Ciao, belle! You're making me blush!

PINUCCIA ARAGOSTA
Blech.

CONCETTA ARAGOSTA^
Disgraziato!

The kids are afraid of him but in most cases trying not to show it, lest he start bullying them.

Ercole comes to an acrobatic stop, revs a few more deafening times, dismounts and saunters to a caffe table, where Ciccio and Guido are hastily setting up his lunch.

ERCOLE
Now! Who wants to watch me eat a big sandwich?

Luca and Alberto gaze at the Vespa, RAPT.

ALBERTO
There it is! That's how we're gonna see the world. Luca walks toward it, in a trance--

A soccer ball rolls in front of him.

SOCCER KID
Hey! Little help?

Luca winds up and KICKS it. Unfortunately, it is pretty off target. It bounces off a few things and hits the Vespa--

WOMAN ON BALCONY
E bàsta!!!

The Vespa begins to TEETER--

ERCOLE
(panicking)
AAAH! LA MIA BAMBINA!

At the last moment, Ciccio DIVES underneath it, cushioning the fall with his body.

Ercole runs over, full of concern--

ERCOLE
Oh, mamma mia-- Talk to Ercole, are you hurt?!

CICCIO
Well, my head kinda hurts--

ERCOLE
Not you, Ciccio! Out of the way!

Oh. The "Are you hurt?" was meant for the Vespa, not for his friend Ciccio, who has definitely sustained some minor injuries protecting it.

ERCOLE
(looks over Vespa)
Oh piccolina, if there is so much as a scratch...

Fortunately, the Vespa is completely unharmed.

ERCOLE
Someone got lucky today. Hmm? WHO GOT LUCKY?!

The soccer kids point to Alberto and Luca. Ercole sizes them up.

ERCOLE
Out-of-towners, eh? Let me welcome you. Benvenuti a Portorosso.
...Ciccio.

He removes his SWEATER, places it without looking into the waiting arms of Ciccio, and saunters up to his latest victims.

ERCOLE
I am delighted to meet you, number one and number two, I love your stylish clothes. Where did you get them? A dead body?
--HA! I'm kidding!

CICCIO
Ha. "Dead body."

Alberto is not sure what to make of this guy.

ALBERTO
Uh, ha ha. Yeah. Well, look, Signor Vespa, I--

ERCOLE
Signor Vespa? Hoho. These guys are funny.
I am Ercole Visconti, five-time winner of the Portorosso Cup.

ALBERTO
The Portorosso what?

ERCOLE
The Portorosso Cup! Per mille sardine--how do you think I paid for my beautiful Vespa?

The gears start going in Luca's head, as he looks at the Vespa--but his train of thought is interrupted by Ercole--

ERCOLE
Hey. Stop looking. She's too beautiful for you.

Poor Luca can only stammer and shrink away from him.

LUCA
Ah...I, I, uhhh...

ERCOLE
(mocking)
I, I, uhhh--oh, I love it. The little guy can't even get a word out.
(waving a hand in front of his nose)
Ugh, And he smells like behind the pescheria.

This is too much for Alberto.

ALBERTO
HEY, MY FRIEND SMELLS AMAZING.

ERCOLE
Sorry, sorry, I'll make it up to him.
Ciccio? Guido?

Guido and Ciccio grab Alberto and hold him back while Ercole grabs Luca and marches him to the FOUNTAIN--

LUCA
What are you doing?!

ERCOLE
I'm giving you a little bath! It's funny. Eh?

Ercole SHOVES LUCA'S FACE TOWARD THE WATER--

DROPLETS begin to hit Luca's face--tiny little green flecks begin to appear on his skin--

LUCA
(struggling)
NO NO NO--

Ercole clocks that something a little strange is going on--

But before he sees it definitively--

GIULIA (O.S.)
HEY!

A girl on a BIKE attached to a CART FULL OF FISH rides to the rescue.

This is GIULIA, 13, brainy, competitive, intense, and a bit awkward. She is 100% incapable of being anyone other than herself.

GIULIA
Ercole, bàsta!

She comes BARRELING through, Ercole jumps out of her way.

ERCOLE
(unexcited, cutting)
Oh, look who's here. Spewlia.
Wow. That's how you're training for the race?

GIULIA
Si certo! Your reign of terror is coming to an end--

ERCOLE
(overlapping, has heard this before)
"...coming to an end." You mean, like a year ago? When you quit in the middle of the race? Because you couldn't stop throwing up?

GIULIA
I didn't quit. They MADE me stop.

ERCOLE
I think that is worse. Now go away. I'm having fun with my new friends.

GIULIA
They're coming with me.
(to the boys)
Hop on. I could use the extra weight.

The boys, relieved, hop on the back of her cart.

ERCOLE
Fine! Go start a club! For losers!

As he is giggling at his own brilliant joke, a fisherman runs up to the MAGGIORE (a policewoman)--

GIACOMO
Maggiore! Another sighting--in the harbor this time--

MAGGIORE
(holding a poster)
I know. We're setting up a reward. Someone's gonna win a nice prize...

ERCOLE
Me! Me! I win the prizes!!
Ciccio, get your daddy's harpoon.
We're gonna catch a sea monster!!

Across the piazza, the boys, hearing this, give each other looks of alarm.

Meanwhile Giulia, stung by Ercole's parting shot, pedals them around the corner-

GIULIA
(ranting)
Sto IMBECILLE! Thinks he can be a jerk cuz he keeps winning the race which he shouldn't even get to do anymore cuz he's too old and too much of a JERK!
(to the boys)
Hey. We underdogs have to look out for each other, right?

The boys are completely baffled by her.

ALBERTO
What's under the... dogs?

GIULIA
UNDER-dogs. You know. Kids who are different... dressed weird...
(defiantly exposing sweaty armpits)
Or a little sweatier than average.

Beat. Giulia knows she can be a little much for people sometimes .

GIULIA
Too much? Too much.
So are you in town for the race?
(beat)
The Portorosso Cup?

The boys remain absolutely silent and perplexed.

GIULIA
Well, uh... good talk. But I gotta deliver these. Always be training, you know?

And she pedals away, hitting a STOPWATCH.

But Luca has realized something.

LUCA
We should ask her about this Portorosso Cup race. That's how the loud scary human said he got his Vespa.

They look back at...

Giulia, now rapidly performing her first delivery--

GIULIA
(racing through transaction)
Buongiorno, Signora Marsigliese.
Due sogliole, perfetto, okaygreatciao!

SIGNORA MARSIGLIESE^
Giulia! Buongio--
Oh.
Uh...
Grazie. 

As she sets off to the next door, Luca and Alberto run alongside her--

ALBERTO
Hey, uh, Spewlia——

GIULIA
GIULIA. My name is Giulia.

ALBERTO
Sure. So when you uh... race... in a cup... what do you get?

GIULIA
Soldi. Prize money.

ALBERTO
Oh.

GIULIA
Oh...kay.

Giulia pedals away, but Luca knows there's more to learn--

LUCA

ALBERTO
(whispering)
No no! Keep going! Ask her about the prize money! Maybe that becomes a Vespa! Just ask her!

ALBERTO^
(whispering)
What? Why? But that stuff is useless! How would that become a Vespa!? Fine fine fine.

ALBERTO
Hello, again.

GIULIA
(wary)
Ciao.

ALBERTO
So, can we turn the money into something else? Something like--

As the three of them turn the corner, they see a MECHANIC'S GARAGE with a beautiful Vespa in front--

LUCA
(pointing to the Vespa)
--THAT!

GIULIA
Pfft. No.
(afterthought)
But it could get you that.

She redirects the boys' gaze to an EXTREMELY RUSTY AND DECREPIT USED VESPA next to the new one.

It is the WORST VESPA YOU HAVE EVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE.

But...

DISSOLVE TO:

.LUCA'S IMAGINATION

He and Alberto are triumphantly riding it through a sea of golden coins.

!BACK TO REALITY:

The boys have a muttery sidebar, gazing at the Vespa.

LUCA,
It's so beautiful.

ALBERTO
Yes. We need it.
(to Giulia)
Great! So we'll just win the race.

His cockiness rubs Giulia the wrong way.

GIULIA
You'll have to beat Ercole.

ALBERTO
Okay, so we'll beat Ercole.

GIULIA
Ha. Thinks he'll beat Ercole, this guy. First of all, GET IN LINE. Every summer that jerk makes my life miserable. So no one's taking him down unless it's ME.

Even Alberto is cowed by this.

GIULIA
Second, this isn't any old race. It's an epic, grueling traditional Italian triathlon: swimming, cycling, and eating pasta. So, you'd need a teammate.

ALBERTO
Well, we'll figure it out. Thanks, human girl.

Giulia heads off once again, and Alberto heads in the other direction. But Luca senses an opportunity.

LUCA
Alberto--what if we join her team?

Alberto frowns. But then something occurs to him.

ALBERTO
Better idea: What if SHE joins OUR team?

He yells to Giulia, who's pedaling away--

ALBERTO
Hey! Spew--
(remembers that's not her name, but can't remember her name)
Uh! Girl!

GIULIA
(exasperated)
Santa Mozzarella.

ALBERTO
Congratulations! You're joining our team!

GIULIA
You wish. I race alone.

As she says this, her cart gets stuck--the boys help get the wheel free--

LUCA
But we could be under the dogs too!

ALBERTO
It's okay, Luca. She'd rather do the whole race alone again. Maybe this time she won't throw up as much!

Giulia frowns. She studies them.

GIULIA
You wanna be on my team, eh? ...Let's see what you got.

EXT. IN FRONT OF THE PESCHERIA - DAY

Luca sits on GIULIA'S BIKE, now disconnected from the cart.

Giulia looks on expectantly.

Luca tries to pedal it. Unfortunately, he has never ridden a bike in his life before this moment.

HE CRASHES.

Alberto tries to give some pointers about a thing he also has never ever done even once.

ALBERTO
Try jumping onto it!

Luca tries this, and crashes again.

ALBERTO
No no no. You gotta show it you're the boss.

Another crash.

GIULIA
Santa Mozzarella.
(to Luca)
Eyes up! Looking down is what's making you fall.

Luca tries this advice--almost crashes again--

But this time, manages to stay upright. He rolls around the piazza, wobbly but exhilarated--

LUCA
WHOA. I'm doing it!

ALBERTO
So can we be on the team?

Not so fast. Giulia needs to see more.

GIULIA
Aspetta! Can you dodge obstacles? What if an old lady crosses your path? Hmmm?

She pretends to be an old lady, tottering in his way--Luca barely manages to dodge her--

GIULIA
Can you withstand PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE VERBAL ASSAULTS?!
(imitating Ercole)
Nice bike, number one and number two, I was kidding, your bike is a disgrace! HA HA HA HA.

She swiftly leans some planks on some barrels to create a difficult TIGHT ROPEY SITUATION for Luca to negotiate--

GIULIA
Can you handle the course's fiendishly difficult terrain?!

Luca grimaces, but rallies himself--

LUCA
(to himself)
Silenzio Bruno.

He WOBBLES his way up and starts across the plank--

But then he sneaks a look down. It's his undoing. He CRASHES.

GIULIA
Hmm.

Luca struggles valiantly to his feet. He's gonna try it again. She stops him.

GIULIA
(to Alberto)
What about you? Can you swim, at least?

ALBERTO
Yeah. I'm amazing.
(Luca elbows him)
-LY baaad at swimming.

GIULIA
You can't swim, you can barely ride a bike... siete un disastro! I mean, where are you even from?

ALBERTO
We're not telling you our secrets!
(immediately)
We're runaways.

GIULIA
Runaways? I dunno, ragazzi...

LUCA
Please!

Luca, still tongue-tied from nervousness, powers through it:

LUCA
My family was gonna send me somewhere horrible. Away from everything I love. But if we win this race, well... we can be free.

Beat. Giulia is moved. She turns to Alberto.

ALBERTO
My life's great. I'm just helping him out.

This is less moving to Giulia. She narrows her eyes and purses her lips, thinking.

LUCA
Just give me one more chance.

GIULIA
No.
You guys want it just as bad as I do. You have the hunger. That's the most important thing.

ALBERTO
I'm definitely hungry.

GIULIA
Perfetto. You eat, you bike, and I swim. ...Underdogs?

ALBERTO
(overjoyed)
Underdogs!

LUCA
(overjoyed)
Underdogs!

!A TRIUMPHANT GATHERING OF HANDS MOMENT--

GIULIA
Now we just need money for the entry fee.
(beat)
From my dad.

Uh oh.

INT. MASSIMO'S KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - DINNER

MASSIMO, Giulia's enormous, terrifying, tattooed, one-armed dad SINGS OPERA as he preps dinner.

MASSIMO
~Per un barbiere di qualita, di
~qualita! BRAVO FIGARO, BRAVO,
~BRAVISSIMO, BRAVO!
~LA LA LA LA. LAAAAAA.

Giulia leads the boys into her dad's cramped little working-class home.

GIULIA
(whispering)
All right. Just let me do the talking. And act casual. He doesn't do well with fear.
(calls out)
Hey, Papa! I brought some friends for dinner. Is there enough for four?

Massimo turns and clocks the boys, MASSIVE CLEAVER in hand.

He looks them up and down, silently.

ALBERTO
What's wrong with you, stup--

Luca jams his hand in Alberto's mouth before he can finish.

Massimo narrows his eyes. But he turns and continues to prep dinner. Giulia gives a reassuring signal to the boys.

HARD CUT to the boys sitting at the table.

Luca is terrified. Alberto clocks the HARPOONS on the wall.

ALBERTO
(whispering to Luca)
What do you think he kills with those?

MASSIMO
(overhearing)
Anything that swims.

Luca feels DREAD. Alberto feels DREAD, but also PROFOUND AWE.

MASSIMO
Did you see the paper today?

GIULIA
That photo's a fake, Papa.
(to the boys, a little embarrassed)
Everyone in Portorosso pretends to believe in sea monsters.

Giulia hands a newspaper to Alberto, who studies it. It has a BLURRY PHOTO of a sea monster, tail visible above the water--

MASSIMO (O.S.)
I'M not pretending.

Massimo takes the clipping from Alberto's hands and VIOLENTLY PINS it to the wall with a knife--

Adding it to a VAST "BEAUTIFUL MIND"-TYPE BOARD OF SEA MONSTER ARTICLES AND PHOTOS--

Luca, drinking a glass of water, SPIT-TAKES onto Alberto. Half of Alberto's monster turns sea monster.

Oh sweet Jesus no. Luca TACKLES Alberto to the floor, before Massimo and Giulia can see him.

Alberto hastily dries off under the table, where no one can see them. No one, that is, except:

MACHIAVELLI, the Marcovaldo family's imposing cat. He growls.

The boys scramble back into their seats.

LUCA
Slipped!

An uneasy beat.

MASSIMO
Dinner's ready. Trenette al pesto.
(beat)
Mangiamo.

Clearly the boys are supposed to start eating. But they have no idea how the utensils work.

So Alberto just grabs a handful of pasta and sticks it in his mouth. Then another.

Luca, hesitantly, follows suit.

The food is delicious. Pretty soon both boys are cramming it into their mouths with the worst manners that you have ever seen.

GIULIA
Uhh. Okay.

MASSIMO
Where did you boys say you were from?

GIULIA
(needing to rescue them)
They're classmates! From Genova. Luca and uhhh---

LUCA
(muttering)
Alberto.

GIULIA^
--hhhhlberto.

MASSIMO
And what brings you to Portorosso?

GIULIA
Funny you should ask! They came for the race.

MASSIMO
(darkening)
The race, huh.

Giulia can feel this is going badly--

GIULIA
Yeah. You know what? Don't worry about it.

MASSIMO
Don't worry about it?

GIULIA
Don't worry about it.

Massimo sets down his glass.

MASSIMO
Giulietta? A word?

Massimo and Giulia confer privately:

MASSIMO
I don't want you doing the race again. You get so upset.

GIULIA
Papà, per favore! I have a team now!

MASSIMO
There's also the entry fee. Money's tight.

GIULIA
I'll work double shifts at the pescheria--whatever you need-—

MASSIMO
(with a painful smile)
I can't sell what I don't have. What I need is more fish in my net. Mi dispiace, Giulietta.

LUCA (O.S.)
...Umm, excuse me?

PULL OUT to show that Massimo and Giulia are just a few feet away from Luca and Alberto. Because this house is very small. Anyway, the boys heard the whole thing, and:

LUCA
We could help!

MASSIMO
(doubtfully)
You know fish?

ALBERTO
We know lots of fish.

Giulia puts on her most winning smile--

GIULIA
Can this face lose?

Beat. Then Massimo sighs heavily and shrugs in resignation--

MASSIMO
You want to work, I'1l put you to work.

The boys celebrate--Giulia is giddy with excitement--

GIULIA
Grazie, Papà

Luca turns to see the cat inches from his face.

LUCA
OH NO.

GIULIA
(stern)
Machiavelli! No! NO--

The cat LEAPS--

HARD CUT TO:

EXT. .GIULIA'S BACKYARD - NIGHT
The boys hurry into the yard, scratched up from the cat.

GIULIA
I'm so sorry about the cat. I don't know what got into him!

LUCA
(woozy)
It's fine. We're gonna head back to, uhh...

He's not sure how to finish the sentence and Giulia realizes--

GIULIA
Do you guys need a place to stay?

CUT TO:

INT. GIULIA'S TREEHOUSE

Luca and Alberto sit on a platform in a tree--Giulia's treehouse. Lights are strung in the branches. Books are scattered here and there--Giulia picks them up--

GIULIA
Oops. Sorry. This is my--

ALBERTO
Your hideout.

GIULIA
Heh. Yeah. My hideout.

She walks along a branch and jumps, not super gracefully, through a window into her bedroom.

GIULIA
...Buonanotte, boys. See you in the morning!

As soon as she is gone, Luca EXHALES in RELIEF--

LUCA
That was close.

ALBERTO
How big was that dad human?! That guy kills things, for sure.

LUCA
I thought we were gonna die like a hundred times.

ALBERTO
Hey. Relax. We're incredible at this humaning stuff.

Luca smiles, starting to come around.

LUCA
Did you see me on the bike? Giulia said "look up" and then all of a sudden, I was riding it!!--

Alberto doesn't love hearing about how Luca learned something from a person who wasn't him.

ALBERTO
(interrupting)
Yeah yeah yeah. Our Vespa's gonna be even better than a bike, though. Because the moment we get it, we're OUTTA here.

EXT. BEACH - DAWN
Like middle-aged commandos--

DANIELA and

LORENZO sneak out of the ocean and onto shore, uncer cover of early-morning darkness. They are here to get their son back.

DANIELA
How could my mother tell him about this town of bloodthirsty lunatics?

LORENZO
I still can't believe he would do this. It's not like him.

Daniela TRANSFORMS while speaking:

DANIELA
Just keep your guard up. There's gonna be land monsters everywhere-- AAIIGH!

Daniela turns to see a land monster (Lorenzo) and attacks him, knocking him to the ground and slapping his face.

DANIELA
NOT [SLAP] TODAY [SLAP], LAND
MONSTER. [SLAP]

LORENZO
DANIELA! WAIT! IT'S ME!

DANIELA
OH.
You scared the scales off of me.

Lorenzo rubs his cheek.

LORENZO
Jeez, you're strong.

DANIELA
Sorry. I'm just a little on edge.

LORENZO
No. I needed that. It really woke me up. Wow! We look horrifying. 

Daniela inspects her BEAUTIFUL HAIR.

DANIELA
Ugh. Gross.
(resolute)
Come on. Let's find our son.

EXT. GIULIA'S TREEHOUSE - MORNING

Luca wakes up in the treehouse. Its branches drip gently--it rained in the night.

He smiles, for the moment oblivious to the fact that the RAIN HAS TRANSFORMED HIM INTO A SEA MONSTER.

He turns to look at Alberto, who has also transformed.

Oh snap.

LUCA
Oh no. Alberto! Wake up!!

ALBERTO
What? --AAAAH!! The sky's been leaking!

Giulia slams open her shutters, cups her hands to her mouth like a trumpet, and plays a REVEILLE--

GIULIA
Papapparapaa pappaparapaaa!

The boys SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE TREE before she can see them--

Then they scramble AROUND THE TREE as the BACKYARD DOOR opens and Massimo leans out, harpoons in hand.

Hastily, they manage to dry off before anyone sees them, except for an agitated Machiavelli.

MASSIMO
All right, ragazzi. You want that entry fee, you gotta earn it. Giulietta, you make the deliveries--

GIULIA
(snatching the list, heading out)
Already makin' em.

MASSIMO
And you two are coming with me.

Luca is anxious; Alberto, intrigued, clocking Massimo's MANY KNIVES--

ALBERTO
Which knife do I get?

MASSIMO
You don't.

EXT. FISHING BOAT - MORNING

Out on the water, Massimo exchanges greetings with Tommaso, on a passing fishing boat--

TOMMASO
Buongiorno Massimo! You'll keep an eye out for those sea monsters, right? We're all counting on you!

MASSIMO
Don't worry, Tommaso, I've got my eyes peeled. They won't get away.

Massimo taps his TRUSTY HARPOON by his side.

Meanwhile the waves are jostling the boys to and fro--they keep almost flying out of the boat and into the water--

MASSIMO
This isn't a joyride. Make yourselves useful.

The boys hastily get to work pulling up NETS.

Machiavelli stalks Luca. Some Hitchcock fun and games that results in Machiavelli POUNCING ONTO LUCA'S FACE.

He is really clamped on there. Luca staggers around, trying to get him off, rocking the boat a little--

MASSIMO
Hey! No goofing around back there!

Luca finally succeeds in FLINGING Machiavelli off his face-- and into the water.

TIME CUT: Luca apologetically feeds an anchovy to a soaking wet, shell-shocked, furious Machiavelli.

Up front, Alberto is sneaking a glance at Massimo's one-armed style. Massimo catches him--

MASSIMO
(nodding at his arm)
A sea monster ate it.

Beat. Then Massimo chuckles--

MASSIMO
Just kidding. This is how I came into the world.

And one-armed, he opens a net with a dexterous flourish--

MASSIMO
Mannaggia. Not a great catch today.

LUCA
It might be because we're over a haunted fish graveyard?

Beat. Massimo is confused. Alberto comes to the rescue.

ALBERTO
(explaining, confidently)
--WE know it's not haunted. The FISH think it's haunted.

Massimo knits his brow. These boys are strange.

ALBERTO
This time of day, most fish will be riiight about there.

Alberto points off into the distance. Massimo is skeptical--

EXT. MARINA - DAY

Giulia races through town on her bike--SKIDS to a halt at the dock--

Checks her POCKET WATCH, then shoots two fists in the air--

GIULIA
HA HA! NEW PERSONAL BEST!!

Then clocks Massimo and the boys returning with a truly EPIC AMOUNT OF FISH.

GIULIA
(in quiet awe)
Santa Pecorino.

MASSIMO
(to Giulia)
Your friends do know fish.

Massimo pats Alberto on the back. Giulia is relieved--

GIULIA
Let's go sign up!!

EXT. PORTOROSSO - DAY

LAUNDRY hangs on a clothes line.

Two pairs of hands whisk it off.

EXT. SEAWALL NEXT TO

GIULIA'S BACKYARD - DAY

DANIELA and LORENZO, wearing the pilfered clothing, sneak into town--

DANIELA
Okay, okay. Now what's our plan. Think, Daniela! --

LORENZO
Hey. Everything's always on you. I want to step up.

DANIELA
Uh... you sure?

LORENZO
(confidently)
Oh yeah. I got this.

And he saunters over to a kid (not Luca) sitting by himself on the seawall enjoying a gelato cone.

LORENZO
Well, hello there, young man. You're not fooling anyone.

The kid licks his gelato, blank-faced and confused.

DANIELA
(under breath/through teeth)
Lorenzo. Uh-uh.
Nope. Lorenzo. Nuh-uh.

LORENZO^
Did you really think you could get away with this? You thought we wouldn't find you? Well, guess what.

LORENZO
It's time for us to go home.

Lorenzo PUSHES the kid into the water.

He is about to follow, when Daniela grabs him.

The kid has not turned into Luca.

Awkward beat.

The kid begins to cry.

LORENZO
(trying to recover)
And... let that be a lesson to you!

DANIELA
RUN. Before its mother gets here.

The adults FLEE--

LORENZO
It turns out I don't got this.

DANIELA
No. But I do. I'll know my son when I--

--into the PIAZZA, which contains MANY KIDS.

DANIELA
--see him.

Daniela gazes around. This is going to be pretty difficult.

DANIELA
Aw, sharks.

EXT. PIAZZA - DAY

Giulia, Luca, and Alberto walk up to a LINE OF KIDS waiting to submit their entries to the PORTOROSSO CUP.

A WOMAN in an ELABORATE COSTUME and MUSTACHE addresses them from a little makeshift stage:

SIGNORA MARSIGLIESE
Fellow Portorossans! It is I! GIORGIO GIORGIONI!!
(hamming it up)
Slayer of sea monsters. And beloved purveyor of pasta!

In the crowd, Luca is alarmed:

LUCA
Slayer of sea monsters?!

GIULIA
That's just Signora Marsigliese. She works for the sponsor for the race.
(exasperated sigh)
This is gonna take forever.

SIGNORA MARSIGLIESE
The finest pasta in Liguria. At a price every family can afford!--

GIULIA
GET TO THE RULES.

SIGNORA MARSIGLIESE
(dry)
Enthusiasm. Love to see it.
(regaining momentum)
To win my famous race, your team must be the first to: Brave the treacherous waters of the bay!! Devour a mystery bowl of my delicious pasta!! And ride to the top of Mount Portorosso--and back!!!

LUCA
That all sounds pretty hard.

ALBERTO
Yeah. Hard to LOSE. We're going to win!

GIULIA
I love your confidence. But don't forget. We have to go through--

ERCOLE
Champion coming through! Ciao, ciao!

--Ercole arrives, Ciccio and Guido trailing behind as usual.

GIULIA
--Ercole.

Ercole plonks down his entry fee.

SIGNORA MARSIGLIESE
Aren't you a little old, Ercole?

ERCOLE
(pretend outrage)
Signora! I'm sixteen!

SIGNORA MARSIGLIESE
You said that last year.

ERCOLE
But this year it's true!
(walking away, addressing the kids)
You might want to save your money, ragazzi, this year Ercole is gonna break the record and make it six in a row--

He notices, with delight, that Giulia has teamed up with Luca and Alberto.

ERCOLE
Oh no. I don't believe it. Spewlia, you teamed up with these vagrants?!

GIULIA
(irritated)
Ignore him.

ERCOLE
(mock-apologetic)
I wish for you that you could. I'm afraid your friends still need to pay the Out-of-Town Weirdo Tax.

Ercole snaps his fingers--Ciccio snatches the money out of Giulia's hand and gives it to Ercole--

GIULIA
HEY!
Ercole--you HAVE to give it back!

ERCOLE
Ercole doesn't have to do anything. He's the Portorosso Cup champion, number one, and number two, his life is amazing and everyone loves him.

GIULIA
They don't love you! They're afraid of you!

ERCOLE
(intimidating, to the crowd)
Raise your hand if you love me. EVERYONE in the crowd, terrified, raises their hand.

ERCOLE
See? Everyone.
(to Alberto)
Even you.
(booping Alberto's nose)
Boop.

This is too much for Alberto. He raises his fists.

ALBERTO
That's it. Come on, Luca.

ERCOLE
Ooh! The vagrants want to fight!

LUCA
(unsure)
Alberto...?

ALBERTO
(hushed, to Luca)
Silenzio Bruno. Remember this is for our Vespa!

ERCOLE
A Vespa? Pfft. Trash like you can't ride Vespas.

Giulia gets in the way before the fight can begin.

GIULIA
Stop.

Every eye watches the STANDOFF:

GIULIA
Ercole, you're just afraid we're gonna put an end to your evil empire of injustice--

ERCOLE
(bored, overlap)
"evil empire of injustice."
Got anything new?

GIULIA
Yeah! HERE'S a new one. You look like a...

Beat. She's got nothing. Ercole smirks.

LUCA
(whispering)
A catfish.

GIULIA
(loudly, triumphantly)
A CATFISH!

This only confuses the crowd. And Ercole. They are not impressed--until--

LUCA
(timidly)
Uh, they're bottom feeders and they also have two sad little whiskers.

Now the crowd starts snickering. Even Guido lets out a little involuntary giggle.

Ercole fumes. He smacks Guido with a sandwich.

Then he turns to Luca, towering over him.

ERCOLE
(advancing)
Listen, Piccoletto. I eat kids like you for breakfast. I dunk them in my cioccolata and GNAM! Finiti!

Ercole leans in and creepily puts an arm around Luca, who cowers.

ERCOLE
So, here. Sign up. I'll make it my mission to destroy you.

He lets this sink in. Then, suddenly, BRIGHTENS--

ERCOLE
Ha ha ha!
(leaving, joking with the crowd)
It's gonna be some race, huh? Sorry, no autographs today!
(to a little boy who is still raising his hand)
You. You can put your hand down.

Luca is absolutely terrified. But then Giulia puts an around him--

GIULIA
HA HA! Luca!
Bravo, we did it!

Luca remembers to breathe. Giulia drags him away--

Alberto lags behind, strangely let down.

.AT THE TABLE:

Giulia slaps the cash down on the table.

GIULIA
Giulia Marcovaldo!

SIGNORA MARSIGLIESE
Ciao, Giulia. Team of one?

GIULIA
Not today!

She parts to reveal Luca and Alberto.

LUCA
Luca Paguro.

ALBERTO
(slightly reluctant)
Alberto Scorfano.

EXT. MASSIMO'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

GIULIA(O.S.)
Ok, ragazzi! We have one week to train!

!BUT TRAINING GETS OFF TO A ROCKY START:

arm

INT. MASSIMO'S HOME

Giulia puts a BOWL OF LINGUINE in front of Alberto.

GIULIA
(ready, set, go!)
Pronti, ai posti, via!

Alberto is about to start when Luca comes in with an ARMFUL of DIFFERENT PASTA DISHES:

ALBERTO
Wait, what!?

GIULIA
Every year they change the pasta. You have to be ready for anything! Could be cannelloni, penne, fusilli, trofie, EVEN LASAGNE!

Alberto shrugs and is about to grab a handful when Giulia raps his knuckles with a fork--

GIULIA
And you have to use a forchetta. It's the rule.

ALBERTO
Rules are for...
(frustrated)
...rule people!

EXT. PORTOROSSO STREETS - UPHILL

NEXT: Luca struggles uphill on the bike as Alberto and Giulia slowly walk behind him.

They are passed by a VERY OLD MAN.

Alberto slaps his hand to his forehead in frustration.

CUT TO:

.AT THE TOP OF THE DOWNHILL--

Luca nervously looks down the STEEP INCLINE.

LUCA
Holy carp. No. I can't.

Of course Ercole, breezily riding by, hears this--

ERCOLE
I know, I know. Ha ha ha ha! And remember, Piccoletto:

He draws a finger across his neck menacingly as he rides off.

GIULIA
Forza! Luca, don't let him get in your head. You can do this!

LUCA
Okay. Silenzio Bruno! Here we go!
(he pushes off)
NOPE. I CAN'T.

He hits the brakes, the front wheel locks up, and he CRASHES.

EXT. SEA

AND FINALLY: Giulia swims in the sea as Alberto and Luca paddle behind.

They watch her, unimpressed.

LUCA
I guess that's how humans swim?

ALBERTO
Man, that's embarrassing.

IN A MOTORBOAT IN THE DISTANCE: Ercole looks through binoculars as his henchbuddies WIELD HARPOONS hopefully--

CICCIO
Any sea monsters?

ERCOLE
(lowering binoculars)
No... but I see some bait.

He GUNS THE MOTOR--

Giulia spots the boat speeding toward them--

GIULIA
Oh no. It's Ercole--

Alberto and Luca start rowing FURIOUSLY. But they are rowing in opposite directions and the boat just goes in circles——

ALBERTO
LUCA! FASTER! FASTER!

LUCA
WHY AREN'T WE MOVING?!

Excole's boat is bearing down on them--Ercole grins maniacally--

GUIDO
(worried)
Ercole--?

At the last minute, Guido grabs the steering and averts collision, instead sending a WAVE over Luca and Alberto--

--splashing Alberto, who turns SEA MONSTER and DUCKS into the boat with Luca--

Fortunately, Ercole missed it. He's too busy berating Guido.

ERCOLE
Guido?!

GUIDO
I--I slipped!

ERCOLE
Ciccio! Slap Guido! Again! Like you mean it!

Giulia furiously doggy-paddles to confront Ercole. Meanwhile, Luca tries to throw a tarp over Alberto but instead hits Alberto in the face, KNOCKING HIM OVERBOARD--

Tbe commotion draws Ercole's attention--he turns to see Luca by himself.

ERCOLE
Where did the other one go?

He spots something purple in the water--he squints--

But then TOPPLES OVER--a FURIOUS GIULIA has rocked the boat by hanging onto the sides to yell at him.

GIULIA
Ercole! Cosa stai pensando, eh?!

Ercole's sweater has fallen into the water. This now occupies 100% of his attention.

ERCOLE
Insane girl! It is wool! It cannot be moistened!

While Ercole is distracted, Luca pulls Alberto on board. Then hastily throws a tarp over him before Giulia, also clambering on board, can see anything--

GIULIA
Well, I think that's enough training for today--

LUCA
Yeah! Agreed!

ALBERTO^
Yup!

As the kids begin to row home, Ercole notices them--

ERCOLE
BAHH! Ciccio! The motor! They are slowly getting away!

Ciccio fumbles with the motor.

ERCOLE
Guido! Slap Ciccio! With contempt!

EXT. PORTOROSSO - PIAZZA - DAY

Lorenzo and Daniela's search for Luca is not going so well, either. Daniela pulls the hat off a kid. Nope. Not her son.

A SOCCER BALL rolls to Daniela, from the kids playing nearby--

SOCCER KID #1
Hey! La palla!

SOCCER KID #2
Kick it!

Daniela KICKS it. She is pretty strong. It knocks a kid into the fountain. She stares at the kid, thinking.

DANIELA
I have an idea.

LORENZO
Uh. Honey?!

DANIELA
Hey guys! Can I play too?!

A kid with the ball tries to JUKE her out. She instead deftly steals the ball and HIP-CHECKS him into the fountain.

DANIELA
Oops! Sorry. I'm not used to legs.

LORENZO
(catching on)
Ohhhhhhhh.

SOCCER KID #3
PRENDILA! THE BALL!

DANIELA
Come and get it.

Another kid approaches Daniela, who now has the ball. She deftly sidesteps and the second kid, too, TUMBLES into the fountain.

She is basically LIONEL MESSI. She DRIBBLES through a few more kids, TRIPPING, CHECKING, JUKING them all into the fountain.

Where Lorenzo checks to see if they're Luca--

LORENZO
(muttering)
Not our kid.
Not our kid.

Daniela approaches the goal, takes a shot, but skies the ball instead--knocking a watering can out of a neighbor's hand-- and drenching the kid below.

Daniela CELEBRATES by hurling another kid into the fountain.

DANIELA
(out of breath)
Let's see Bianca Branzino do THAT!
(dolphin impression)
ECK ECK ECK ECK ECK ECK

.NEAR THE PESCHERIA:

Luca HEARS his mother's distinct DOLPHIN CALL. He looks over and sees two adults who look like the human versions of his parents over by the fountain. Uh oh.

He ducks into the yard after Giulia and Alberto--

GIULIA
Good effort, team. You've earned your pasta tonight.

ALBERTO
(desperate)
Can I *please* eat with my hands.

--as the parents regroup, still having not found their son.

LORENZO
Well at least you won! ...I think!

EXT. GIULIA'S TREEHOUSE - EVENING
Luca and Alberto confer in the treehouse--

LUCA
Uh, Alberto? I think I might've seen my parents

ALBERTO
No way. I told you, they're not coming here.

Luca doesn't know how to push past Alberto's dismissiveness——

LUCA
But what if they did? They're gonna send me to the deep!--

ALBERTO
Relax! It's never gonna happen.

Giulia arrives.

GIULIA
(determinedly positive)
All right, boys. Pretty good today, but let's talk technique--

Massimo arrives, too.

MASSIMO
Hey, ragazzi!l I need some help with the nets.
(looking to Alberto)
You! The big strong one. Andiamo.

Alberto is reluctant to leave. But he does like being the big strong one.

ALBERTO
I'll be right back.

Alberto exits with Massimo, leaving Luca and Giulia. She sees he's rattled, and ventures to comfort him.

GIULIA
Hey. We're gonna win.
And you'll get your Vespa.
...Why do you want a Vespa again?

LUCA
Oh--because it'1l be amazing. Every day me and Alberto are gonna ride someplace new. And every night we'll sleep under the fish.

He indicates the STARS that are starting to come out. Giulia is thrown for a loop. She decides to just go with it.

GIULIA
The, uh... fish. Yes! Good.

LUCA
What'll you do when you win?

GIULIA
Ohoho. I'll get up in front of everyone and say, "TOLD you I'd win!!"

LUCA
Yeah!
(beat)
And then what?

GIULIA
I don't know. That's it!
Look. During school, I live with my mamma in Genova. And every summer, I come here, and everyone thinks I'm just some weird kid who doesn't belong.

This really lands with Luca.

LUCA
I think I know how you feel.

GIULIA
Right?! That's why we gotta win!!
The town will cheer our names--
(a little too excited)
ERCOLE'S LIFE WILL BE RUINED--
(stopping herself)
Sorry. Too much? My mom says sometimes I'm too much.

LUCA
No way! Not for me.

Giulia smiles. She watches Luca look at the stars, that he might think are fish.

GIULIA
(unable to let it go)
You know those aren't fish, right?

LUCA
Of course they are! Alberto told me all about it.

GIULIA
Come with me.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - MOMENTS LATER
Luca follows Giulia up onto the roof and across PORTOROSSO'S BEAUTIFUL ROOFSCAPE. A night stroll above a lovely sleepy little town.

They finally arrive at a little balcony.

Giulia uncovers a TELESCOPE and makes adjustments--

GIULIA
This is a telescope. Old Man Bernardi lets me use it. It makes faraway things seem close. Look.

She hands it over to Luca--who looks through it--

!AT A GALAXY.

LUCA
WHOA.

GIULIA
See any fish?

LUCA
Then what are all those?!

GIULIA
Stars. Like the sun. Giant, raging balls of fire!

LUCA
(to himself, realizing)
Alberto was wrong.

GIULIA
And stars are circled by planets.

Through the TELESCOPE, she shows him SATURN--

GIULIA
That's Saturno. It's my favorite.
(geeking out hard)
It's the lightest of the planets. They say if there was an ocean big enough to hold it, it would float--

As she speaks, his imagination takes hold--

!BEGIN IMAGINATION SEQUENCE--

Luca runs on the ring around SATURN--

Giulia FLIES by on a DA VINCI FLYING MACHINE--Luca joins her on a second one--

PILOTS his way through the STARS and above ROMAN RUINS--

They fly over PINOCCHIO, on his way to school--

PULL OUT FROM IMAGINATION to:

INT. GIULIA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Luca is utterly absorbed in Giulia's SCHOOLBOOKS--that's what's been firing his imagination this whole time. He is electrified, peppering her with questions——

LUCA
So this is how machines fly?
And there are big towns called cities?
Like even bigger than Portorosso?

GIULIA^
Sì sì!
Sì! Like Genova!
Literally twenty times bigger!

LUCA
(back to the space book)
And we're all on a big round rock, floating around a star, in the... "solar system"?

GIULIA
So cool, right?!

Luca pages through excitedly--the UNIVERSE gets BIGGER and BIGGER before his eyes as he asks her--

LUCA
And is there anything beyond the solar system?

GIULIA
Only a galaxy FULL of solar systems!

LUCA
Then what?!

GIULIA
A universe FULL of galaxies!!

LUCA
AND THEN WHAT?!

GIULIA
And THEN...
(beat, realizing)
...I don't know. But next year in Advanced Astronomy I'm gonna use my school's telescope. So maybe I'll find out! That thing's HUGE. I wish I could show it to you.

LUCA
JUST PROMISE YOU'LL TELL ME
EVERYTHING YOU SEE!!
(catching himself)
Sorry. Too much?

GIULIA
(overjoyed)
Never.

They're interrupted--

ALBERTO
(in the window)
Hey, Luca! I've been looking everywhere for you.

LUCA
Oh! Sorry--

ALBERTO
Come on, let's go.

Luca turns to Giulia, clutching the book.

LUCA
Could I maybe--borrow this? Just for tonight——

Giulia opens the book, CROSSES OUT her name, and writes "Luca" on the first page.

GIULIA
You can have it.
The universe is literally yours!!

LUCA
(blown away)
Wow. Thank you!!

ALBERTO
Luca!!

EXT. PORTOROSSO STREETS - NIGHT

Alberto leads Luca through the nighttime alleyways to a destination of his own--

LUCA
Where are we going?

ALBERTO
I got something to show you.

Luca is still buzzing with excitement.

LUCA
Alberto, you won't believe this--
(pointing to the sky)
Those aren't fish!

ALBERTO
What?

LUCA
Yeah! Giulia explained it to me. They're fires. But like a million times bigger-—

ALBERTO
(dismissively)
No, they're not.

EXT. MECHANIC'S GARAGE

They arrive outside the MECHANIC'S GARAGE and look in the window at the beat-up VESPA they want to buy, the FOR SALE sign still on it. Alberto slaps a drawing on the window--

ALBERTO
Take a look. I thought of every single thing we're gonna need. Also I added flames.

LUCA
That's so cool.
(realizing)
And we can bring a telescope too!

Luca draws a TELESCOPE on Alberto's drawing.

ALBERTO
YEAH! That shoots lightning!

Alberto adds LIGHTNING coming out of the telescope.

Luca ERASES Alberto's lightning, to Alberto's irritation--

LUCA
No, no, no. You look through it. Giulia says there's an even bigger one at her school.

Luca stops. Getting a BIG IDEA:

LUCA
Wait! What if we visit her there?

ALBERTO
Why would you want to do that?!

LUCA
It... kinda sounds interesting?

ALBERTO
The whole reason we're getting a Vespa is to live on our own! We don't need school! We don't need anybody!

LUCA
Couldn't we just try it? Just for a few days...?

ALBERTO
Luca--sea monsters can't go to school! What do you think is gonna happen when they see your fish- face?

Luca is deflated. But before he can reply:

!THUNK!

Ercole's harpoon SLAMS into a nearby SEA MONSTER RELIEF.

Ercole, Ciccio, and Guido saunter towards our boys--

ERCOLE
Hey. Look who it is. And with no Giulia to hide behind.

Luca is nervous but Alberto insists on standing their ground.

LUCA
C'mon, let's go--

ALBERTO
Nah.

ERCOLE
Something's fishy with you two. I mean besides the smell. You're hiding something.

ALBERTO
Is it... that we're smarter than you? I mean, we're not really HIDING that, it's just kinda obvious.

ERCOLE
You know, people think I'm a nice guy. Always joking around.

Ercole SHOVES Alberto against a wall.

ERCOLE
But really, I'm not.

Ciccio and Guido keep Alberto PINNED to the wall.

LUCA
STOP!

Ercole SHOVES Luca to the ground.

ERCOLE
Wait your turn, Piccoletto.
(to Alberto)
I want to make myself very clear. This is my town, number one--

He SOCKS Alberto in the stomach--

ERCOLE
--and number two, I DON'T WANT YOU IN IT--

LUCA
I said STOP! They turn. Luca, TREMBLING, is AIMING THE HARPOON at Ercole.

Ercole smirks. He takes a step toward Luca.

ERCOLE
(disdainful)
Put that down, Piccoletto. You'll hurt yourself.

LUCA
(terrified)
Let him go.

Ercole nods to Ciccio and Guido, who release Alberto.

ERCOLE
Go. NOW. Before I change my mind.

Luca and Alberto back away--then break into a RUN-- Luca throws the harpoon down as they round a corner--

ERCOLE
(calling after them)
Nobody wants you here, idioti! Keep running!

EXT. OUTSIDE MASSIMO'S HOME - NIGHT
At the door to Giulia's backyard--

LUCA
Why did you make him mad? We should have left!--

But Alberto again is in absolute denial of reality.

ALBERTO
We're fine! I had it under control. All you gotta do is follow my lead, remember?

He heads into the backyard before Luca can respond--

EXT. GIULIA'S TREEHOUSE - NEXT MORNING
The boys are DEAD ASLEEP. Giulia does her patented TRUMPET IMITATION--

GIULIA
Papapparapaa pappaparapaaa!

The boys are JOLTED upright into wakefulness:

!BEGIN TRAINING MONTAGE, AS THE DAYS COUNT DOWN TO THE RACE--

INT. MASSIMO'S KITCHEN

Alberto struggles with the fork--

EXT. STREETS OF PORTOROSSO
Luca pedals uphill, past kids eating watermelon--

Who are abruptly DRENCHED with water balloons--

Dropped by Daniela and Lorenzo, on the balcony above them--

INT. MASSIMO'S KITCHEN

Luca and Alberto placate Machiavelli--

EXT. GIULIA'S TREEHOUSE - EARLY MORNING
The boys are dead asleep again. This time it's Massimo who wakes them up--cart for Luca, BUTTER KNIFE for Alberto--

EXT. MASSIMO'S FISHING BOAT - MEANWHILE

Massimo pulls up FISHING NETS one-armed;

Alberto sees a SEA MONSTER-SHAPED SHADOW in the water;

Before he can do anything, Massimo sees it too--he grabs his harpoon and PLUNGES it into the shadow--Alberto is HORRIFIED;

Fortunately, when Massimo pulls the harpoon out of the water-- REVEAL--it was only a CLUMP OF SEAWEED. Massimo is disappointed;

Alberto, FRAZZLED and TWITCHY-EYED because he thought for a second he had just witnessed a murder, EXHALES--

EXT. HARBOR - EVENING

LORENZO and DANIELA sneak up behind two kids eating gelato--

But are distracted by a MONSTER MOVIE POSTER. Is that guy Ugo? That guy really looks like Ugo.

EXT. MASSIMO'S BACKYARD - MORNING
The boys, dead asleep as usual, are awoken by Giulia-—

GIULIA
Rise and shine! Only two days till the race!

They are so tired they can barely move. But Giulia gets an idea-—

INT. MASSIMO'S KITCHEN - MORNING

And gives the groggy boys two cups of...

GIULIA
Espresso.

The boys sip it. And perk the heck up.

EXT. STEEP PORTOROSSO HILL - DAY

Luca BOOKS IT up the hill, as the watermelon-eating kids cheer him on--

GELATO KIDS
Go, Luca! / You got it!
Vai, Luca!

ERCOLE
(walking past)
Hey! Don't cheer for him!!

EXT. HARBOR - STAIRS

Lorenzo shoots a SPRAY BOTTLE with abandon, failing to impress Daniela and drenching an infuriated bystander.

MAN (O.S.)
MA CHE FAI?!!

INT. MASSIMO''S KITCHEN - DINNER

Alberto struggles to get TRENETTE AL PESTO onto his fork.

Massimo notices. He holds up his fork for Alberto to see. And demonstrates twirling a forkful.

Alberto carefully imitates Massimo... And manages to capture a forkful of his own. Finally!

He turns to Giulia and Alberto for approval. But they're preoccupied with another stupid book.

Alberto eats, irritably. Stupid Giulia.

!--END MONTAGE--

EXT. PIAZZA - FOUNTAIN - DAY

DANIELA and LORENZO sit at the fountain, DEFEATED. (A passing kid recognizes them as the adults that are throwing kids into fountains, turns, and runs away.)

DANIELA
I don't know, Lorenzo. Was I too hard on him?

LORENZO
No. You were just trying to keep him safe. It's my fault. I wasn't paying enough attention to him.

DANIELA
But I was the one who tried to send him away.
...I just never in a million years would have thought he'd do this. It's like I don't even know...

As she is talking, a boy (Luca) passes, pedaling a bike carrying his two other friends (Giulia, Alberto)--

GIULIA
Dai forza! You can do it, Luca!

DANIELA
(eyes narrowing)
...who he... IS...
LUCA?!

Luca SPOTS HIS PARENTS and pedals faster--

LORENZO
LUCA!!!

EXT. STREETS - DAY
Luca furiously pedals up a different street.

GIULIA
Where are we going?

LUCA
Uh... a shortcut!

GIULIA
Steeper, rough terrain. I like it!

Alberto rolls his eyes. Giulia turns to him--

GIULIA
Why aren't YOU training?

Alberto pulls out a WAD OF PASTA from his pocket and eats it.

ALBERTO
(irritably)
I'm always training.

EXT. TOP OF THE HILL - DAY

They crest the top of the hill. Luca is absolutely exhausted. Giulia checks her POCKET WATCH.

GIULIA
Bravo, Luca. That was your best yet!

Below them, a TRAIN heads out of the station, up the coast--

GIULIA
Oh! Guys, look! That's the train to Genova.

LUCA
That goes to your school?

Giulia nods. Alberto rolls his eyes.

LUCA
I was wondering actually... is your school open to... everyone?

GIULIA
Well, it costs a little money, but... I guess!--

Alberto hates where this is going. He takes over impatiently--

ALBERTO
Great. Thank you, Giulia, for showing us the boring thing that takes you to the terrible place. Now can we focus on what matters? If we lose this race, we're not going anywhere!

Luca holds his bike and gazes down the hill.

LUCA
Santa Mozzarella. The downhill.

GIULIA
I know it looks scary. But here's what you need to know--

ALBERTO
(interrupting)
Would you stop bossing him around?

GIULIA
WHAT is your problem?!

ALBERTO
I'm his friend! I know what he needs!

GIULIA
Oh yeah? Then what does he need?

Alberto straddles the front of the bike, Luca on the back.

ALBERTO
ME.
We'll just ride it like we did on the island: together.
ANDIAMO!

GIULIA
No!

But Alberto has already kicked them off.

They careen wildly down the hill, way too fast and out of control, knocking things over, barely staying upright--

LUCA
ALBERTO, STOP!

ALBERTO
THAT'S BRUNO TALKING!

LUCA
NO--I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S JUST ME--

The boys UPEND A CHESS GAME--

CHESS PLAYER
Disgraziati!

Luca tries to gain control of the bike--

ALBERTO
Let it go!

LUCA
Look out!!

In their struggle, they go over a guard rail and SAIL OFF A CLIFF, into the sea.

EXT. HARBOR - MOMENTS LATER

Around the PROMONTORY, Ercole hears SCREAMS and a big SPLASH. He grabs his harpoon and jumps to his feet--

ERCOLE
Porca paletta! What was that?! Eyes on the water! Move, move!

EXT. UNDERWATER - MEANWHILE

Down in the water, Luca and Alberto can distantly hear and see Giulia high above them, calling out worriedly--

GIULIA
Luca?! Alberto?!

LUCA
She'll see us--come on!

Luca furiously swims off--Alberto follows him--

EXT. ABOVE WATER - SUBSEQUENTLY - SUNSET

They exit the water down the coast where no one can see them. Alberto knows Luca's furious at him. He tries to explain--

ALBERTO
Look, I was just trying to show you how to do it right--

LUCA
You don't KNOW how to do it right!

ALBERTO
I got us down the hill, didn't 1?

LUCA
You CRASHED! INTO THE SEA!

ALBERTO
It's fine--

LUCA
NOTHING is fine! My parents just saw me!

ALBERTO
Luca--your parents aren't here.

Alberto's continued denial of the truth enrages Luca even further--

LUCA
You don't! Know! What you're talking about!!

ALBERTO
Look. This town is making you crazy. We just need to win that Vespa and get outta here.

LUCA
It's not gonna be any different! I don't want to--
(stopping and gathering himself)
I want to go to school.

It now is Alberto's turn to get angry.

ALBERTO
THAT again?! WE CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL!

LUCA
You're just afraid you can't do it!

ALBERTO
I'M NOT AFRAID.
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GETS AFRAID.

Alberto SHOVES him. Luca SHOVES Alberto back!

LUCA
Shut up!

!THEY FIGHT!

LUCA
owl!

ALBERTO^
GRRRR!!

ALBERTO
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SHE SEES YOU?
WHEN ANYONE SEES YOU?

LUCA
Get off me!!

GIULIA (O.S.)
YOU'RE ALIVE!--

They turn to see

GIULIA--she runs up and hugs them in relief.

GIULIA
(playfully, to Alberto)
You're never allowed on my bike again. Stick to food, big guy.

Alberto whirls away from her in irritation and fury. Giulia now begins to clock that something's wrong.

GIULIA
Uh, what's going on?

ALBERTO
Nothing. Let's just get back to training--

But Luca senses an opportunity.

LUCA
Actually, we have something to ask you. We were wondering... if we could come with you to your school?

Giulia is thrilled.

GIULIA
Santo Pecorino! That's the best idea ever!! Yes! Of course!!

Luca, overjoyed, takes Giulia's hand--and shows her the handshake that Alberto taught him.

LUCA
Piacere, Girolamo Trombetta.

Alberto, watching this betrayal, FUMES. He has to stop this. However he can.

ALBERTO
Hey, ah, Giulia? Your school... does it take all kinds of people? I mean, what if some of them were... not human?

LUCA
2

Alberto.

ALBERTO
What if some were... Oh, I don't know... sea monsters?

GIULIA
(confused)
Sea monsters?

ALBERTO
I doubt your school would even accept sea monsters, right?

LUCA
(gritting teeth)
Ha ha! That's a weird joke!

Luca urgently signals to Alberto to stop--but--

ALBERTO
Yeah, I know, it's kinda hard to imagine. So let me just show you. And with that, Alberto DIVES into the water. Luca gasps.

GIULIA
Ugh. Alberto, we don't have time to goof around-- Alberto emerges a SEA MONSTER. Giulia SCREAMS. Luca is FROZEN.

GIULIA
HELP! --Don't hurt us!

ALBERTO
(forcefully)
SEE!? I knew this would hap--!

But Luca, in the moment, realizes there's something he can do, too--

And he points at Alberto and cries:

LUCA
SEA MONSTER!

To seem like he didn't know. Like he's a human, too. Like Alberto's the only one. NEARBY BUT OUT OF SIGHT:
Ercole and his goons overhear--

ERCOLE
Did you hear that? BACK TO SCENE:
Alberto is shocked, confused, betrayed:

ALBERTO
Luca?

But Luca just shakes his head, teary-eyed.

Protectively, Giulia gets between Luca and Alberto.

GIULIA
(to Alberto)
STAY BACK.

And before Alberto can say anything else, OVER THE ROCKS come Ercole and his awful friends, WIELDING HARPOONS--

ERCOLE
SEA MONSTER! THERE IT IS!

ERCOLE comes CHARGING toward him--

Alberto realizes he has to get out of here. He gives Luca a truly miserable look--

ERCOLE
NOW!

Alberto turns, and dives into the water, as Ercole and his goons take aim and THROW THEIR HARPOONS--

LUCA
No- --which miss, barely. Luca, heartbroken, watches Alberto swim away.

ERCOLE
(to Luca and Giulia)
Idioti! You let it get away!
(to Ciccio and Guido)
To the boat! WE'RE GONNA KILL A SEA MONSTER! !
Ercole and his cronies race off--

Leaving Giulia and Luca, stunned.

INT.

MASSIMO'S HOME

They return to Giulia's home to find Massimo preparing pasta for them--

MASSIMO
There you are! I made your favorite --trenette al pesto--

Massimo stops, seeing it's just the two of them--

MASSIMO
Where's Alberto?

Luca tries to cover--

LUCA
Ah... he left, Signor Marcovaldo.

Beat. Massimo puts down the bowl and puts on his coat.

MASSIMO
Do you know where he went?

LUCA
(nervous)
No--but I don't think he wants anyone looking for him--

MASSIMO
Maybe not. But just in case.

Massimo exits.

Giulia is silent.

Luca, needing to fill the silence, starts BABBLING--

LUCA

GIULIA
Okay. Well. The two of us can
(trying to stop him)
still do the race. You'll

swim, you'll eat, you've done Luca... both before, and I'1l do the

ride, I mean that's allowed, Luca? right? It should be fine, we're still okay--

LUCA!

Finally, she grabs a glass of water and splashes it at him- he holds out his hands, which transform--

Giulia exhales. She knew it. He's a sea monster, too.

GIULIA
"Sleeping under the fish"! Now I get it.

LUCA
I... I can explain--

GIULIA
Of all the places for sea monsters to visit--PORTOROSSO?! Have you SEEN this town?!
(MORE)
eieeeneiignas Reteteherne My father HUNTS SEA MONSTERS! Luca, you have to get out of here--

LUCA
(pleading)
But I thought we were underdogs.

GIULIA
(anguished)
Do you think I WANT you to leave? This is the happiest I've--

She stops herself.

GIULIA
Look. It's just not worth it.

LUCA
You don't understand!

GIULIA
No I don't. Risking your life? For a Vespa?

LUCA
My parents were gonna send me away. I was never gonna see him again. That's why we... did all of this. A beat, as Luca realizes what he's done.

LUCA
(miserably)
But it's over now. Goodbye, Giulia. I'm sorry.

Giulia SINKS.

EXT. SHORE - NIGHT
Luca sits by the shore staring out at ISOLA DEL MARE. Dimly he can make out a fire, burning on the roof.

He knows what he has to do. He heads into the water.

EXT. ISLAND - NIGHT

Luca approaches Alberto's hideout hesitantly--walking past some of Alberto's belongings, which now litter the ground, broken and scattered, the aftermath of a miserable outburst.

The rope ladder has been thrown down too.

So Luca scales the tower without it--

INT. ALBERTO'S HIDEOUT
And emerges into a hideout that is in ruins.

LUCA
Alberto?

But Alberto is nowhere in sight. Everything has been ripped off the shelves, thrown to the ground, broken.

Even the VESPA drawing is on the floor, ripped in half.

ALBERTO (O.S.)
What are you doing here?

Luca turns. Alberto is watching him from the steps to the roof.

LUCA
(needing the words, but not having them)
I'm--sorry. I never should have done that. I wish I could take it back--

ALBERTO
Great. You're sorry. Now go away.

Alberto goes up to the ROOFTOP. Luca gazes sadly around at the WRECKED HIDEOUT. His gaze settles on where the VESPA POSTER hung. It's been ripped off the wall-- And where it had been are TALLY MARKS IN THE STONE that Luca has never seen before.

EXT. ROOFTOP - SUBSEQUENTLY
Luca finds Alberto staring miserably into a CAMPFIRE.

LUCA
Alberto? What are those marks on the wall?

Alberto shrugs but says nothing.

Beat.

LUCA
(insistent)
Tell me what they mean.

ALBERTO
I started when my dad left.

LUCA
You were living here alone for... that many days?

ALBERTO
I just stopped counting after a while. He said I was old enough to be on my own. I just thought that... maybe he'd change his mind.
(beat)
Honestly, though, I get it. He's better off without me. You are too.

LUCA
That's not true.

ALBERTO
(gently)
Yes, it is. You're not like me. You're the good kid. And I'm just the kid that ruins everything.

LUCA
SILENZIO BRUNO. That''s just a dumb voice in your head. You taught me that.

And getting a Vespa--seeing the world--your ideas are the best!

ALBERTO
(exploding)
Just let it go! Okay? You and I should have never have been friends in the first place.

LUCA
(pleading)
Don't say that.

But Alberto turns away from him.

LUCA
Alberto...

ALBERTO
GET OUTTA HERE!
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU AGAIN!

Tears well in Luca's eyes. But an IDEA starts to form.

LUCA
Okay, I/1l go.

=-I'11 go win the race.

ALBERTO
What?

LUCA
(realizing)
And then the Vespa will be ours! And we'll ride away, together!

ALBERTO
Luca, that's crazy.

LUCA
(shrugging)
Well... maybe I'm crazy. And just like that-- Luca JUMPS OFF THE ROOF--

LUCA,
TAKE ME, GRAVITY!

ALBERTO
LUCA!

He tumbles through the tree, lands on the ground in a HEAP--

ALBERTO
What are you doing?!

LUCA
I'll be back tomorrow! I'm gonna fix this!!

EXT. PIAZZA - RACE DAY

At the registration table, Signora Marsigliese is PERPLEXED--

SIGNORA MARSIGLIESE
You want to... split up your team?

REVERSE to Luca, holding a RUSTY BIKE:

LUCA,
Yes--if it's allowed--

Giulia, on her way to the starting line, spots Luca--

GIULIA
Luca?! What are you doing here?

LUCA
Don't worry! I'll race on my own!

Giulia turns to Signora Marsigliese in shock--

SIGNORA MARSIGLIESE
You can if you want--I don't recommend it--

But Luca's already headed OFF before anyone can stop him-- Giulia is horrified but also doesn't want to blow his cover--

GIULIA
(calling after him)
But--how are you gonna--I mean--

what happens when--YOU CAN'T SWIM!!

EXT. STREETS - DAY

Meanwhile, Daniela and Lorenzo are still looking for Luca when a RACE JUDGE
(the priest)
confronts them--

PRIEST
Volunteers! You're late. One cup for each kid.

They look down at a table full of CUPS OF WATER--clock that they're for the race--realize this is gonna work out pretty well for them--

DANIELA &

LORENZO
Yeah yeah yeah. One cup per kid. Got it.

The priest then hands them a BUCKET and SCRUB BRUSH--

PRIEST
And here.
(apologetically)
(MORE)
nea eee For when Giulia... you know.
(mimes throwing up)
EXT. STARTING LINE
IN THE SKY: A storm is approaching.

IN THE STANDS: Massimo and Machiavelli hold an encouraging sign for

GIULIA--

MASSIMO
Forza, Giulietta!

Giulia smiles, apprehensive. Next to her, Ercole pours OLIVE OIL on Ciccio, who is stretching.

ERCOLE
Ciccio, hold still.
(explaining to Giulia)
Olio d'oliva. He will cut through the water like a knife. An oily knife.

Then they SEE--

LUCA, CLOMPING up to the starting line in Alberto's FULL-BODY DIVING SUIT.

ERCOLE
Oh, this makes me laugh. Even your terrible friends don't want to be your friends!

Luca glances nervously across at his COMPETITORS.

GIULIA
(ignoring Ercole)
LUCA! THIS IS A VERY BAD IDEA!

ERCOLE
HEY! VAGRANT!
CAN'T AFFORD A PROPER SWIMSUIT?!

SIGNORA MARSIGLIESE
(addressing crowd)
Signore e Signori! The Portorosso

Cup is about to begin!

We know there's been a few

sightings lately, but fear not! If

any sea monsters show up today--

we're ready for them.

She indicates the FISHING BOATS all around the harbor, brimming with FISHERMEN wielding HARPOONS AND NETS.

Luca is terrified. He glances over at Giulia. She signals to him once more to GET OUT OF HERE--

SIGNORA MARSIGLIESE
Swimmers, take your mark!--

The STARTER BELL rings!

The swimmers TAKE OFF--

!EXCEPT LUCA, PARALYZED BY FEAR--BY BRUNO--
Then he takes a deep breath.

And puts the DIVER HELMET on.

And sloshes into the water!

Giulia, swimming up ahead, PUSHES FORWARD--

But in front of her and everyone else, Ciccio is off to a great start.

The only problem is that the oil covering Ciccio's body is beginning to attract some HUNGRY FISH.

cICcIo ow! YOwW--

Giulia passes him, rounds a buoy, and heads back to shore, over the head of--

LUCA, on the sea floor. He can see the swimmers outpacing him above, despite his best efforts——

To make matters worse, the glass on the diver's helmet SHATTERS--he has turned SEA MONSTER! --

Giulia is the first out of the water, passing Ercole, who is screaming at Ciccio, thrashing in agony——

ERCOLE
Swim, Ciccio! Idiota! SWIM!!

Giulia finishes dressing into her street clothes and RUNS toward the PASTA-EATING STAGE, where the pasta is

GIULIA
HA HA! Trenette!

She twirls a forkful as Luca EMERGES from the water. Ercole TRIPS him--the diver helmet goes FLYING-- Luca TURTLES inside it before anyone can see his scaly head.

And he scrambles headlessly to the pasta table, manages to dry off without anyone seeing him, and plops down--

next to Giulia, who's thinking: Luca, you idiot, you're gonna get yourself killed.

He fumbles with the trenette.

LUCA
Come on

Giulia, MUNCHING FURIOUSLY, can't not help him--

GIULIA
UUUGGGH.

Impatiently, exaggeratedly, she demonstrates to him HOW TO PROPERLY FORK THE PASTA--

LUCA
Thank you!--

GIULIA
(angrily)
DON'T THANK ME.

Ciccio finally runs from the water, wailing, little fish hanging from his oily skin.

ERCOLE
Stop crying and tag Guido!!

He does. Ercole FROG-MARCHES Guido to the pasta-eating stage. As Giulia FINISHES her pasta and SLAMS the fork down:

GIULIA
FINITO!

She stands up, suddenly gripping her stomach, GROANING, and hobbles over to the BIKES. She's still in the lead!

Ercole angrily looks at Giulia pedaling off
(though slowly).

ERCOLE
Per mille cavoli, Guido! FASTER!

Luca hastily forks pasta into his mouth as other kids around him finish and tag their partners, who run off--

He's way behind. But so is Ercole, who is now physically SMUSHING PASTA into Guido's MOUTH--

ERCOLE
Eat, idiotal! Pit veloce!

The kid sitting next to Guido, groans her protest--

PASTA KID
Hey! That's not allowed!

ERCOLE
HE'S DONE.

Ercole SLAMS the fork down for Guido, grabs his LIMP HAND, uses it to slap his own hand, and sprints to his bike.

Guido sinks his head into his bowl. Finally Luca slurps down the last noodle. He is the last kid at the table. But he's still going. He high-fives himself.

LUCA
(frazzled)
DONE!

He drops the fork, runs to his bike, lets out an insane BURP, and speeds off after the pack.

As the STORM BREWS OVERHEAD--

EXT. STREETS OF PORTOROSSO

DANIELA and

LORENZO, at the water table, are frightening the racers passing them, who recognize the adults who have been terrorizing them for days.

LORENZO RACE KIDS
Thirsty? AAAAAAAAHHH | Uh... NOOO! Water, anyone? PLEASE STOP!

NOT AGAIN! !

Then Daniela squints at the last kid, who is bringing up the rear but closing in fast on the pack--

DANIELA
That's him. That's him!

LUCA! STOP!

They LUNGE FOR

LUCA--he SWERVES, barely evading them--

LUCA
Sorry Mom! Sorry Da I have to do this!!

Lorenzo is FURIOUS. Daniela is a little
(or completely)
distracted by how much human butt he is kicking.

LORENZO
GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!

DANIELA
WOW, he's fast.

!HE SURE IS--

Luca SURGES PAST one kid, then another, then another-- As the storm continues to gather overhead--

Up AHEAD, Giulia's lead is swiftly dwindling as Ercole gains on her--she covers her mouth, trying not to VOMIT

Ercole passes her. Rudely SLAPPING HER HELMET to add injury to insult.

ERCOLE
Oops! Scusa!

GIULIA
(pure rage)
Rrrrrrrgh!!
I'LL CATCH YOU ON THE
(wheeze, hiccup)
DOWNHILL!

ERCOLE
Oh, Spewlia. You've never even MADE it to the downhill.

Ercole takes a moment to slow down, luxuriate in triumph, perhaps fix his hair--

And as he does, LUCA passes HIM!

ERCOLE
WHAT? !
(huffing and puffing)
(MORE)
"ENN
Impossible!

He's cheating!

Arbitro!! Arbitro!!

Luca doesn't reply--just keeps CHUGGING UPWARD--he puts some distance between him and Ercole--

He's in the lead. He could win this thing! And then, the rain finally begins to fall. Little spots of transformation appear on his arm--

LUCA
Oh, no no no no... AT THE WATER STATION:
Daniela and Lorenzo notice the RAIN-- And hastily duck under the TABLECLOTH-- DOWN IN THE PIAZZA:
Among the grownup onlookers, the UMBRELLAS come out.

Massimo watches, a little confused, as a CAFE UMBRELLA bobs along through the crowd.

It makes its way out of the crowd and up the road. AT THE TOP OF THE HILL:
Luca pedals around the tower, trying to race the rain--

But there's too much. He'll transform. He stops under an awning, overlooking the downhill portion of the race--

Antsy, he waits out the downpour--

LUCA
Come on, come on! I'm so close!

ALBERTO (O.S.)
LUCA!

Luca LOOKS UP--

Alberto is RUNNING toward him, clutching the CAFE UMBRELLA
(that was him, down in the piazza)--

ALBERTO
Just stay right there! I'm coming for you--

Luca smiles.

But here comes Ercole-. passing him--

he's caught up with Luca and is now

ERCOLE
What's wrong, Piccoletto? Afraid of a little rain?

Ercole smacks Luca's helmet and continues, heading right for Alberto, who tries to scramble out of his way--

ERCOLE
For the last time, you two don't belong here. Get out of my town--

Ercole KICKS Alberto-- The cafe umbrella goes flying-- Ercole chuckles, then GASPS-- Alberto has transformed.

A sea monster scrambles to his feet on the cobbles of Portorosso, surrounded by dumbstruck, horrified onlookers--

ERCOLE
SEA MONSTER! !

TOWNSFOLK
MAMMA MIA!!! SEA MONSTER! STOP THAT

THING!

ERCOLE
Ciccio! My harpoon! VELOCE!

Luca and Alberto are face to face--human Luca under the awning, sea monster Alberto in the rain.

LUCA
(aching)
Alberto--!

And he begins to take a small step toward him.

ALBERTO
No! Stop!

Alberto backs away.

ALBERTO
Just stay there. You're still okay.

The safety of his friend is all that's left--it's all he cares about now--

Alberto turns and makes a RUN for it, back down the hill--

LUCA
ALBERTO, WAIT!

For a moment or two, it seems like he's going to make it. Then a net snags him.

TOWNSFOLK
DON'T LET IT GET AWAY!

Alberto struggles, but he can't get free--

LUCA
NO!!!

Luca knows what he must do.

He PEDALS OUT INTO THE RAIN to save his friend.

He turns SEA MONSTER--Giulia, watching, gasps

GIULIA
Santa Ricotta.

Luca plows straight through the crowd--

LUCA
ALBERTO!

REACHES OUT A HAND to Alberto and HOISTS him onto the bike--

ERCOLE
AAH! WHAT?!?

And they speed down the hill.

ALBERTO
You really ARE crazy.

LUCA
Learned it from you. Let's get to the water!

Behind them, FURIOUS

ERCOLE finally gets his harpoon from Ciccio--he jumps on his bike to chase them down--

Giulia pedaling hard behind him-- CUT TO:
Luca and Alberto continue through the race--

ALBERTO
(to racers, as they pass)
Hey there. Excuse us.

ERCOLE
OUT OF THE WAY!
VIA! VIA!
Ercole HOISTS HIS HARPOON--

ALBERTO
LUCA! !

Alberto gets Luca to swerve just in time. Through a door, and into an apartment.

WOMAN IN APARTMENT
(0.S)
AHHHH!!

LUCA
SORRY SORRY SORRY

--then back onto the course, right between Ercole and Giulia-- Ercole now in front of them--

ERCOLE
HUH?

Daniela and Lorenzo, still under the tablecloth, spot Luca
(FULLY SEA MONSTER)
speeding by.

DANIELA

LORENZO
Oh no!

LUCA!! SON!

Ercole turns, balances himself, rides backwards, a showboat to the end. He hoists his harpoon and aims it at the boys.

ERCOLE
You shoulda left when I told you. Now I gotta kill some sea monsters.

The boys have nowhere to go--

But Giulia does.

GIULIA
So long, evil empire of injustice.

She SWERVES RIGHT INTO

!ERCOLE. BIKES AND PEOPLE GO FLYING.

Giulia goes TUMBLING to the ground. And the boys ride past to safety, into the PIAZZA. But they see Giulia grit her teeth in pain-- And a few feet from the water, Luca hits the brakes. The boys run back to make sure their friend is all right. Meanwhile the piazza crowd is now reacting to the sight of two SEA MONSTER BOYS who have skidded into the square and are now running toward a fallen human girl--Massimo's daughter-—

MASSIMO
MOSTRI MARINI...!

Give me that!

He SWIPES a HARPOON from a fisherman and runs to confront them--

LUCA
(concerned)
Giulia! Are you all right?!

GIULIA
(dazed)
Yeah... I'm, uh... okay... Thanks guys...

She smiles gratefully, as they pull her to her feet.

The three kids stand. They are surrounded by FISHERMEN and Massimo, blocking any escape with nets and harpoons.

MASSIMO
(disbelieving)
Giulietta?

GIULIA
Papa... I--

Massimo can't believe his eyes. Alberto's smile fades.

The fishermen close in.

GIACOMO
You're not going anywhere.

And Ercole comes running in from the other side, re-armed with his harpoon, pointing it at the kids

ERCOLE
I saw them first! The reward is MINE!!

Luca stands up to him.

LUCA
We're not afraid of you!

ERCOLE
(contemptuously)
No. We're afraid of YOU.

Sure enough, the crowd looks pretty FRIGHTENED of what is happening.

ERCOLE
Everyone is horrified and disgusted by you. You're monsters--

GIULIA
STOP! They're NOT monsters!

ERCOLE
Oh yeah? Who are they, then?

Massimo SILENCES EVERYONE--

MASSIMO
I know who they are.

Massimo stands FIRMLY in front of the kids. HARPOON IN HAND.

MASSIMO
They are... Luca and Alberto. He DROPS his harpoon. Then LIFTS

ALBERTO'S SEA MONSTER HAND into the air--

MASSIMO
And they won.

Everyone is STUNNED, even the kids.

LUCA

ALBERTO
Wh... what? Really?

ERCOLE
They can't be the winners! They are not even... people!

Massimo looks to Signora Marsigliese for confirmation--

MASSIMO
Signora Marsigliese?

And he nods significantly at the boys' BICYCLE, LYING ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.

Signora Marsigliese studies it, deliberates, and finally shrugs--

SIGNORA MARSIGLIESE
(confirming)
Technically... legally... Yes. They won.

LUCA

ALBERTO
HUH? We won?

The fishermen aren't quite buying it. But Massimo holds strong. He will not let anything happen to these kids.

And now, a number of them LOWER THEIR HARPOONS. Some, shaking their heads in DISGUST, head away to leave. Others remain, muttering to each other, confused--

Ercole tries to RALLY them all back--

ERCOLE
Who cares if they won? They're SEA MONSTER:

But as Ercole is preoccupied, Giulia SNATCHES HIS HARPOON-- and, with the boys' help, snaps it in half.

ERCOLE
HEY!
Ciccio! Guido! Another harpoon!

Even Ciccio and Guido don't obey right away.

ERCOLE
Idioti! Be useful for once in your pathetic lives...!!

And with that, Ercole loses his only two friends. They give each other a look.

cICcIo Guido?

GUIDO
Ciccio.

They grab Ercole, drag him to the fountain, and dump him in.

ERCOLE
GAHHH!!!

Ercole THRASHES WILDLY in the fountain's two feet of water. Ciccio drops Ercole's WOOL SWEATER in after him.

cIccro Oops.

GUIDO
Thhhhppppbbbbbbt tt.

ERCOLE
(weeping)
No, no--piccolino--

And Giulia watches from afar, realizing what this means.

GIULIA
(in shock)
..-It's over. The reign of terror IT'S FINALLY OVER!!

Before Luca can react, Daniela and Lorenzo finally make it over to him, now SEA MONSTERS.

DANIELA

LORENZO
Luca! Luca!

Daniela swoops him up in an embrace--

DANIELA
(wildly conflicted)
You had us worried half to DEATH and you must NEVER do that again and you raced your little TAIL off and kicked SO MUCH HUMAN BUTT and I'm so PROUD of you and I AM SO MAD AT YOU--

LUCA
(starting to come out of his shock)
I love you, Mom--

She wraps him in a hug. Lorenzo, too.

The crowd watches in astonishment as SEA MONSTER PARENTS embrace their SEA MONSTER KID-

Signora Marsigliese walks up to our kids with a TROPHY.

SIGNORA MARSIGLIESE
Signore e Signori, the winners of this year's Portorosso Cup...

The underdogs!

And it finally sets in with the kids that THEY'VE WON.

LUCA &

ALBERTO &

GIULIA
(jumping up and down)
WE WON! I can't believe we won!! Underdogs! Woohoo!

The other kids start celebrating, too.

TOWN KIDS
Go underdogs! Ercole lost Wow! I know sea monsters!

The ARAGOSTA SISTERS glance at each other, drop their umbrellas--and TRANSFORM too!

A priest sees them and FAINTS. Portorosso struggles to come to grips with the sea monsters among them. Some people don't love what's happening, like the

MAGGIORE, who clutches a sea monster BOUNTY POSTER. But others are more open-minded. BENCH LADY
(to the Maggiore)
Gimme that.

The BENCH LADIES take the poster and rip it up--

And HUMAN KIDS, so excited to know sea monsters, celebrate the new CHAMPIONS OF PORTOROSSO--

CUT TO:

!A RICKETY WHEEL ROLLS ALONG THE COBBLES--

PULL OUT to show that it's our THREE HEROES on their LONG- DESIRED, VERY JANKY VESPA.

EXT. GARDEN - EVENING

They zoom into Massimo's garden, where a dinner party has already begun with both human and sea monster guests.

The Vespa makes a horrendous noise. Parts fall off.

ALBERTO
(happily, proudly)
It's so perfect.

Massimo serves pasta to

LORENZO and

DANIELA...

MASSIMO
Trenette al pesto. Mangiate.

«and

GRANDMA?!

GRANDMA
Grazie.

DANIELA
Mom?! What are you doing here?

GRANDMA
I come to town most weekends.

Across the yard, Daniela watches Luca and Alberto and Giulia LAUGHING and GOOFING OFF on their VESPA.

DANIELA
(quiet, reverent)
What he did today was amazing. But We can't let him stay in this world.
(beat)
Can we?

GRANDMA
(seeming to agree)
Some people will never accept him.
(here's the turn)
But some will.

And he seems to know how to find

the good ones.

BACK ON THE KIDS--

GIULIA
So where will you go first?

ALBERTO
Oh, we're gonna stick around here

for a bit.
(patting the Vespa)
We gotta fix this thing up before we take it across the entire earth.

GIULIA
(a little nervous about

the boys spending their

lives on this thing)
Okay. Just don't forget to... pack.
(realizing)
SANTO GORGONZOLA--I need to pack! For school!

LUCA
(realizing)
--Oh yeah.
(wistfully)
School.
(trying to be upbeat)
You're gonna learn so much...

Giulia sees in his face how much he wishes it was him, learning all those things at school.

GIULIA
I can leave you some books...?

LUCA
(SUPER EXCITED)
YOU CAN?!

Come on, Alberto--

Giulia and Luca RUN into the house. Alberto smiles, watching them.

He is deep in thought. He is realizing something pretty important, about his friend. And about himself.

He looks down at the Vespa and knows what he has to do.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - EARLY MORNING

On the TRAIN STATION PLATFORM, Massimo says GOODBYE to Giulia, all packed up.

MASSIMO
.+.And you have your lunch for the train?

GIULIA
si.

MASSIMO
Sweater if it gets cold?--

GIULIA
For the MILLIONTH time, si. I love you too, Papa.

She HUGS him-- And turns to the boys:

GIULIA
Santa Mozzarella. We did it!

ALBERTO
Well, Giulia--can't wait to race next summer.

GIULIA
Or we could just have fun.

She swoops the boys up in a BIG HUG. They both SMILE.

LUCA
Ciao, Giulia.

GIULIA
Ciao, ragazzi! A presto--

Giulia and Alberto exchange a WINK. Luca doesn't see it.

She heads into the train. Luca, tearful, trying to hide it, watches her disappear into it.

LUCA
Well--let's go fix up our Vespa--

But Alberto is holding a little slip of paper.

ALBERTO
Yeah, about that. Uhh, crazy thing. I...might have sold it. Alberto hands it to him--it's a TICKET TO GENOVA.

Luca studies it.

Then turns to see his PARENTS AND

GRANDMA arriving on the platform with a packed bag.

LUCA
(confused)
Mom? What are you all doing here?--

DANIELA
IF.
You promise to write to us EVERY SINGLE DAY, and be as SAFE as possible, and I mean SAFER than safe...
(deep breath)
You can go to school.

He can barely wrap his mind around this.

LUCA
I CAN?!

LORENZO
It's all arranged, actually. You'd stay with Giulia and her mom.

GRANDMA
Your friend talked them into it. It wasn't easy.

Alberto smiles and shrugs, like, "Yeah, I guess I did."

DANIELA
Luca? Do you promise?

LUCA
YES! YES I PROMISE!

THANK YOU--

Fighting emotion, Daniela reaches forward to fix Luca's hair, but stops herself.

DANIELA
(tearful)
Just remember. We are ALWAYS here for you. Okay?

LUCA
Hey.

Look me in the eye.

You know I love you. Right?

DANIELA
I know.

She gives her son a kiss... and lets him go.

LUCA
(excited)
--Come on Alberto! The train's gonna leave!

Luca, headed to the door of the train, realizes Alberto is standing back a little. And there's a funny look on his face.

Luca begins to put it together.

LUCA
Where's your stuff?

ALBERTO
Yeah, well. You see...

LUCA
You are coming, right?

Alberto considers it.

ALBERTO
I would. But. Massimo asked if I wanted to stick around, move in maybe... and I just thought, ah... I think he needs me. You know?

Luca begins to falter.

LUCA
I can't do it without you.

ALBERTO
But you're never without me.

Alberto hands him a scrap of paper that's been taped back together. His old DRAWING of the two of them on the Vespa. The greatest drawing Luca has ever seen.

ALBERTO
The next time that you jump off a cliff, or tell Bruno to quit bothering you... that's me.

But it's not quite enough for Luca.

LUCA
But how am I gonna know you're okay? Alberto's face crumples a little. He wraps his friend in the hug to end all hugs.

ALBERTO
You got me off the island, Luca. I'm okay.

And as the train readies to leave,

Luca stands on the steps of the train, and does one last handshake with Alberto.

ALBERTO
Piacere, Girolamo-- Trombetta.

LUCA
Seriously, what does that mean?

ALBERTO
No idea. Go find out for me, will ya? The boys RELEASE THEIR GRIP, as the train begins to move--

Carrying Luca away from Alberto, who has to run now, to keep pace.

He reaches the edge of the platform. He jumps off into the rain. He TRANSFORMS--

ALBERTO
Go Luca! Go000! Luca watches Alberto CHEER HIM OFF TO GENOVA.

Then loses sight of him for good, as the train enters a TUNNEL.

For a few beats, Luca is in the darkness, alone. He comes out of the tunnel. He looks at the island.

He watches PORTOROSSO DISAPPEAR around the corner.

He is leaving everything he has ever known. But he wipes away his tears.

He leans into the rain. He feels the wind on his face. He transforms.

And he turns, and gazes into a BRILLIANT FUTURE.
